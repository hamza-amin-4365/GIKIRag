GIK Institute has established Wellness Center in the new academic block on June 2021. Sehat Kahani has helped us to establish the wellness center while HEC and UNDP funded the project. Mental health counseling is provided to students and tele-mental health has been introduced.
The GIK Institute is the first private sector university that has established the centre. Amid frequent closure of educational institutions and start of online classes in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic the students faced difficulties, anxiety and even depression around the world. The governments and educational institutions started introducing the measures to carry out research regarding the impact, frequency and severity of psychological and mental health issues of the students.
Higher level of anxiety of the students caused by Covid certainly needed the measures for solving their mental health problems created due to academic disruption and education-related mental distress. Under the programme, a software application will be used for rendering online counselling as well as treatment services to the students.
