### Introducation
The explosive growth in the area of electrical engineering during the past two decades has impacted almost every facade of human life. Developments in Digital Electronics, Signal Processing and Communications have heralded the age of Information Technology. Sophisticated digital hardware combined with novel control and signal processing algorithms have directly contributed to the landing of probes on distant planets as well as efficient operation of massive industrial units. Advances in electrical engineering are allowing us on one hand, to monitor crop growth from satellites, predict weather disturbance worldwide and control nuclear power plants remotely, while on the other hand, are making advanced technology readily accessible to the common man through advances in bio-medical engineering and personal communication systems.
The rapid pace of development of technology in the modern world has blurred the traditional boundaries of the field of electrical engineering. It is not clear any more where electrical engineering stops and another discipline starts. Automobile engineering has been the traditional domain of mechanical engineering, yet, state-of-the-art electronics is at the heart of ultra-low emission vehicular technology. Electronics drives the modern artificial heart, and surface emitting lasers are invading computers. Agriculturists monitor growth, and satellites map the earth providing a detailed view of crop distribution, soil erosion conditions and deforestation.
The program in Electrical Engineering has been developed to cater to these diverse needs of industry. The GIK Institute is an integrated institute and the programs of study in Electrical Engineering have been developed to allow students to take courses in all the different disciplines available here. The Faculty of Electrical Engineering (FEE) offers courses leading to both Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in Electrical Engineering.
Graduate program can be pursued in FEE with specialization in one of the following three areas:
i. Microelectronics, MEMS and ASIC Design,
ii. Power and Control System, and
iii. Communication and Digital Signal Processing.
### Course Work
###### **MS degree**
The courses offered by the FEE are categorized as core courses, faculty and inter-faculty electives. An MS student, specializing in any area, will be required to take all the core courses and minimum two courses from his/her choice of the area of concentration. The remaining courses are elective and can be selected from elective courses offered by FEE and other faculties.
###### **PhD degree**
The courses to be taken by the student will be decided by the studentâ€™s Ph.D. guidance committee and approved by the Dean of the Faculty. Out of eight courses, four must be from the list of FEE courses, and the remainder could be from other faculties.
