  1. AIESEC


AIESEC in GIKI started after a lot of effort and dedication and was sustained through remarkable young leaders who wanted to carry on the self-driven experience AIESEC has provided them with to their counterparts in Ghulam Ishaq Institute. It originated as an expansion initiative from its parent branch – AIESEC in Islamabad after sheer hardwork on the students part. It has then gone on from strength to strength, establishing a concrete name for itself in the AIESEC network, and graduating onto the status of an Official Expansion.  
AIESEC in GIKI has engaged multiple students both inside and outside of the university, providing them with both leadership oppurtunities and life-altering exchange programs. It has flowered into a respected entity of AIESEC Pakistan.
  1. LDS


Much has been said about our strong traditions, our excellent pedigree, the glory of our history. These are the undeniable facts: the list of Quaid-e-Azam medalists is populated almost exclusively by LDS alumni; these same alumni have spread far out into the globe, to the pinnacle of academic and industrial achievement; we’ve produced debaters par excellence, legendary speakers whose wit has become immortalized on national television, in debating halls across the country, and in some bright sparks, across the global debating community.
What is it about LDS that brings out the best in people? The answer to that question is easy. We, as a society, believe in the power of reason. We argue, we lacerate, and yet we communicate. We accept diversity and encourage opinions, we cherish inflaming conversations and absolutely love off-kilter references. For all that, our members emerge as competent, well-rounded human beings, perfectly capable of communicating our unique selves to the world and inordinately eager to accept the strange, the new and the wonderful into ourselves.
So if you have an interesting story or a good joke, or if you love Joyce or Nietzsche or Dostoevsky or Kafka, or if you really dig Tool’s lyrics, or the poetry in Bob Dylan’s verse, or if Godard or Christopher Nolan reached into your soul, and most importantly, if you like talking (or would like to learn to talk) about all of these things, come see us…

In order to implement these activities as a significant role in the extra curricular activities of GIKI, an aspect of entertainment has to be added in order to innovate these activities. The objective is to explore the talent of Gikians in the field of science. We believe that by developing the culture of discovery and exploration, the Gikians can not only reach the pinnacle of their intellectual capacities, and become the best engineers that they can be, but they can make the country proud of them.
The endeavors of science society in this regard have been very fruitful as it has conducted a series of events like, All Pakistan Science Fair, Science Marathon, Science Kasoty, Astronomy night, invention contest, Quiz La’ Cafe and Eureka.
