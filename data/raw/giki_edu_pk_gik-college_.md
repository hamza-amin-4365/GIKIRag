### Gik School & College
The founding fathers of the Institute were conscious of the need for providing good education to the children of the employees. Keeping this objective in view, the GIK Institute School (now known as the “GIK College”) was established in April 1994 with a modest intake of 25 students. The school has grown rapidly and the current student enrollment in well above 650. College classes were started in the school a few years ago. Now it is an English medium high school/college affiliated with the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Islamabad. Along with academic excellence, due importance is given to character building and personality development by involving children in a large number of creative co-curricular activities and sports programs. Educational excursions, debates, declamations, science modelling projects and children’s art and crafts exhibitions are a regular feature of the educational program. The Institute’s transport is provided for pick and drop of the employees’ children who live outside the Institute.
