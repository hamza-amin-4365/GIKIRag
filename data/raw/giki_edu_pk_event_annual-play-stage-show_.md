The year is 1668, Mughal emperor Aurangzeb has seized the throne and is now the ruler of the great Indian subcontinent, he has deemed music and arts as unislamic and has imposed a nationwide ban on the practice of all forms of art. His moral police have waged a war against musicians, poets and artists. Warrants for Baba Maqdoom’s arrest have been issued and it is feared that he may be hanged soon, he thus confides in his closest and most cherished disciple, Waris Shah, and asks him to make a journey to Malkan Hans and write ‘Heer, Ranjha’, one of Punjabi literature’s most renowned work. The road to the completion of this literary wonder is not a convenient one, Waris is faced with the fear of being caught by Aurangzeb’s moral police, in addition to numerous allegations being levied against him.
