It is indeed a pleasure for me to be patron of **Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization â€“ ORIC** , a central place to communicate with the external world in future. ORIC is a newly established business unit to provide best of its services to industry, alumni and students of GIK Institute. ORIC is made responsible to look after alumni relations, career counseling and placement for students, industry relations, fund raising and business development activities, communication and marketing.
GIK Institute is committed to building and nurturing lifelong relationship with its alumni and is looking forward to strengthen it further through its Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization. The office is aiming to form a mutually beneficial relationship between the Institute and alumni, wherever they are located; also by providing alumni with opportunities to ensure they feel a part of GIK Institute for good.
ORIC is planning to introduce new activities; that are advantageous to our alumni, students and GIK Institute in future. Reunions and networking events at difference locations, centrally organized by ORIC would give you a great chance to catch up with old friends. We are also planning to organize networking events between our alumni and current students such as guest speaker lectures, career counseling sessions, mock interview programs, etc.
I would like to invite here further suggestions and feedback from students and alumni, also I would appeal for your support to help us in working out these activities.
