Open Source Processor Design Workshop at the GIK Institute, where we’ll dive deep into the world of RISC-V processors. Over three days, from June 4th to June 6th, you’ll learn how to design and implement a single-cycle RISC-V processor.
We’ll cover everything from writing Verilog code and verifying it with testbenches to FPGA implementation and creating the GDS-II layout. Whether you’re a student, educator, or industry professional, this workshop is a fantastic way to enhance your skills in processor design.
