###### **SOPHEP- (Society for the Promotion of Higher Education in Pakistan)**
In this modern day and age, engineers and scientists are not isolated from the management of the firms they work in. As a matter of fact, they themselves can become senior managers later on. Due to this, companies are perpetually on the look-out for people with solid communication skills. The implication for students is that besides studying hard, they must strive to develop solid presentation and communication skills as well.  
One of the major problems facing today’s Pakistani students is the lack of interaction between the Pakistan’s academic and professional communities. As a result of this, young undergraduates lack sufficient knowledge of the professional world and companies remain unaware of the great potential of these future workers.  
SOPHEP was formed to help close this information gap and form a bridge between these two vital communities. In this regard, SOPHEP holds workshops that are conducted by successful GIK alumni that help students refine their people-skills and become job-smart. The society also offers students projects from the industrial community which gives budding engineers and managers the chance to gain valuable real-world experience – something that looks great on any C.V.

Women in Pakistan have traditionally not played their due role in professional fields, but an evident change is gradually emerging. In fact, a quiet revolution is taking place in Pakistan. Women are determining the dynamics of this revolution and will certainly influence the economy of the country in the coming decades.

It is a common observation that the number of women joining the male-oriented professions is constantly growing. The economic development of a nation is not possible at all without active women participation. The women engineers in GIK aspire to educate and equip other women with new skills and assist them in getting productive employment.
