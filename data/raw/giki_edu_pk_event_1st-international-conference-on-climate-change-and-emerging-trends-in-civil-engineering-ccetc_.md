### **Mission & Specific Objectives**
The mission of the “Sustainable Developments in Water, Environment, and Structures Under Climate Change “conference is to bring together representatives from academia, industry, and policymakers to exchange and explore recent initiatives, advanced knowledge, and scientific and technological innovations in sustainable processes.
**The specific objectives of the conference are under**
  * To identify the specific pending issues that need to be tackled about the main implementation challenges related to Water Resources Management; Environmental Risks; and Sustainable Structures.
  * To analyze the main opportunities and challenges for the different means of implementation to advance.
  * To showcase how the different means of implementation can promote the necessary transformative change.
  * To make proposals on the role of different actors and how they can contribute, specifically Business, Governments (including local governments), civil society, academia, and media.
  * To draw lessons on differentiated responsibilities, appropriateness, and transferability of different tools and approaches in different contexts but also on issues of scaling up and transitioning.
  * To analyze how lessons learned by, specifically concerning water cooperation, and women’s engagement.


### **Scientific Significance of the Event**
The faculty members/students will present their research, share new ideas, and comprehend the research ethics. They will get a chance to network with experienced speakers to implement the current needs of society. They can present their research work in the form of presentations/posters relevant to their research, get feedback from seasoned researchers, and thus convert their weaknesses into strengths.
There is a sprout need to avoid the risks of environmental sustainability such as food security, water pollution and scarcity, air pollution, and energy shortfall. Hence this region needs sustainable solutions regarding the conversation of water resources and the environment. Therefore, it is the need of the day to take the initiative in this area. This conference will share sustainable solutions to resolve the issues. By bringing the researchers and experts from all over Pakistan, it is expected that they can make recommendations to the government level for developing new technologies for utilizing the natural resources available in Pakistan.
The academics who will read the proceedings from overseas will get a chance to learn about the problems faced by Pakistan and similar developing countries, thus get an opportunity to develop and participate with universities and academics in Pakistan to simulate real work problems and discuss opportunities for technological advancement; this poses for them a unique opportunity to apply knowledge outside their normal environment.
