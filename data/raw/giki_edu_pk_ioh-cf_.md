# Industrial Open House 2023
Each year, the industry is invited from all over the country to view our graduating student’s Final Year Projects, hold interviews for Jobs & internships, conduct presentations and have a one-to-one interaction with the student body.
The professionally competent graduates of GIK Institute are highly rated in the job market. They are serving with distinction in reputed national and multinational organizations. Besides teaching and research, the Institute is also serving as an R&D center for the national industries for finding the solutions of their problems. The highly qualified and professional faculty through research and lab facilities inculcates up-to-date knowledge in the minds of students which ultimately pave the way for the growth and advancement of the industries in the cut throat competition in the international market and also help them in facing the challenges of industrial standardization and globalization. To establish liaison between the Institute and industry and to find appropriate places for its future graduates in the competitive market, a tradition has been set in the Institute to hold an annual event Industrial Open House and Careers Fair by Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization – ORIC at the campus before graduation ceremony every year.
The Industrial Open House and Careers Fair is annually held with the purpose to provide:
  * A meeting place to the Institute’s senior students and their prospective employers
  * An effective platform for industry-university interaction
  * An opportunity for the industry representatives to acquaint themselves with the academic environment provided to the students


At the occasion of Industrial Open House and Careers Fair, we develop several publications every year, such as Graduate Directory (for the batch passing out), list and details of Final Year Projects to be exhibited, Labs and Technical / Research Facilities available at GIK and Faculty Profiles. Please CONTACT US if you need any of these publications and we will send out the electronic copies to your email, as we do not keep them available here online to be downloaded due to Personal Information Security.
