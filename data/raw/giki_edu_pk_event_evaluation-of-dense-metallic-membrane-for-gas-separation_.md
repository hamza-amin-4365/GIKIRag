**Title:** Evaluation of Dense Metallic Membrane for Gas Separation
**Date and Time:** 16th May, 2022 at 10:30 AM**  
Venue:** FMCE Main Lecture Hall
**About Speaker**  
Dr Abbas Saeed Hakeem graduated with BSc & MSc (Engineering) specialising in Materials Science and Metallurgical Engineering from the Punjab University and University of Leeds, United Kingdom (1997 & 2001), respectively. During his MSc, the focal theme of his research entailed the phase transformation in steel, aimed at the “Tempering of Engineering Steel”. He obtained his PhD in Materials Chemistry (Technical/Engineering), specialising in Sialon hard materials, from Arrhenius Laboratories at the University of Stockholm in Sweden (2007). He conducted instrumental research with Arrhenius Laboratories for the designing and development of “Ln-SiON, LnSiAlON glasses, Its synthesis, and characterisation” (2002), and “Novel route of oxynitride glass synthesis and their characterisation” (2003-2007). After completing his PhD, he joined the GIK Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Pakistan, as an Assistant Professor (2007-2010). At GIK Institute, he taught undergraduate and graduate courses related to Ceramics and glasses, X-ray diffraction and crystallography, Strength of materials, Powder metallurgy, Materials science (basic), Alloy production, Heat treatment and processes, thermodynamics of materials, Materials characterisation techniques, Phase equilibria, Materials structure and defects, Casting tech. and foundry technology, etc. Currently, Dr Hakeem serves as Senior Scientist/Professor at the Interdisciplinary Research Center for Hydrogen & Energy Storage (IRC-HES), King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (KFUPM, 2010-To date). His area of research at the IRC-HES is related to the synthesis of nanostructured-based hard materials, composites materials, light metals/composites and the characterisation of synthesised and sintered materials and various hybrid materials.
Additionally, he has mastered hands-on technical skills with inorganic materials (solid-solid and solid-liquid state synthesis) and has supervised many projects. His areas of research expertise and interests are inclusive of but not limited to · Advanced Materials Development for Engineering Applications · Synthesis of Hard, Light Materials, and Composites Materials · Metallic, Ceramic and Polymeric Composites Development · Sintering of Nano-Structured Light Metals and Composites By Advance Sintering Techniques · Development and Management of Client-Focused R&D Programs · Project Planning and Management · Management and Entrepreneurship. He is the author/co-author of over a hundred publications and fifty conference proceedings (including invited speaker, conference proceedings, seminars and conferences). On the applied side, he is also the inventor of over twenty (20) International Patents, which have been instrumental in building a number of industrial collaborations and facilitating step changes and process improvements.
