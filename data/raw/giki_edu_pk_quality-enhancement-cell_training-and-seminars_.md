**Graduate Program Self-Review Visit (GPR)**
At Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology (GIKI), we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of academic excellence in our graduate programs. In line with this commitment, the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) under the Higher Education Commission (HEC) conducts the Graduate Program Self-review (GPR) Visit process. This process is a key component of the national quality assurance framework, aimed at fostering continuous improvement and ensuring that GIKI’s graduate programs meet both national benchmarks and global standards.
The GPR Visit provides an opportunity for GIKI to undertake a thorough self-assessment of its graduate programs, engage with quality assurance experts, and receive constructive feedback. This collaborative process helps to reinforce our dedication to delivering innovative, relevant, and high-quality education that prepares our graduates for leadership in academia, industry, and research.
