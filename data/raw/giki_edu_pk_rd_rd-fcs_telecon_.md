TeleCoN
### Overview
**The Telecommunications and Networking (TeleCoN)** is an inter-faculty Research Lab jointly established by the [**Faculty of Computer Sciences & Engineering**](https://giki.edu.pk/fcse/) and the [**Faculty of Electrical Engineering**](https://giki.edu.pk/fee/). The Executive Committee of SOPREST and GIK Institute in its 62nd meeting accorded approval to establish the TeleCoN Research Group/Lab. The TeleCoN Lab seeks to foster high-quality research focused on the design and analysis of communication systems and network architectures and protocols that are cost effective, scalable and meet the emerging needs for high-performance, high-capacity and reliable communications. The TeleCoN Research Group promotes fundamental and applied research employing cutting-edge networking, communication and signal processing techniques and technologies. General areas of interest of the TeleCoN Research Group include resource allocation, traffic management, teletraffic engineering, security, energy efficiency, cooperative communications and quality of service in Internet, wireless sensor networks, mobile ad hoc and vehicular networks, cognitive radio networks, multi-user relay networks and 5G heterogeneous cellular networks. Other activities of the Centre include the organization and co-organization of seminars, workshops, lectures, trainings and invited talks to consolidate the educational and research work and to promote the objectives of the group.
