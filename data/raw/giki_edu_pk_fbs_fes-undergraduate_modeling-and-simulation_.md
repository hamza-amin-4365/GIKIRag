Modeling and Simulation Engineering is a discipline of designing mathematical model of actual or theoretical physical systems executing the model on a computer and analyzing the execution output. Due to its dynamic nature, the modeling and simulation engineering field has tremendous potential for creating student interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines. Computer simulations are extensively being used in aerospace industry, automobile systems, financial markets, environment systems and medical sciences. Modeling and simulation is also important in situations where the description of the system behavior by experimentation might not be feasible due to the following reasons.
  * Some experiments may be very harmful
  * Some experiments might take longer time than expected and may also be very costly
  * There might be obstructions during experimentation
  * We might not have access to inputs and outputs.
