---|---  
Introduction to Dynamics: Basic concepts, Newtonâ€™s laws, units, solving problems in dynamics, rectangular coordinates (x-y), normal and tangential coordinates (n-t), polar Coordinates (r-?), and space. Types of Motion: Curvilinear motion, relative motion (translating axes), constrained motion of connected particles, force, mass, and acceleration, Newtonâ€™s second law, equation of motion. Work and Energy: Work, kinetic energy, potential energy. Impulse and Momentum: Linear impulse and linear momentum, angular impulse and angular momentum, special applications, impact, central-force motion. Kinetics of Systems of Particles: Introduction, generalized Newtonâ€™s second law, work-energy, impulse-momentum, conservation of energy and momentum, steady mass flow, variable mass. Plane Kinematics of Rigid Bodies: Introduction, rotation, absolute motion, relative velocity, instantaneous center of zero velocity, relative acceleration, and motion relative to rotating axes.
