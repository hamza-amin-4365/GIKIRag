Introduction: Fluid mechanics I review. Differential Analysis of Fluid Flow: Fluid element kinematics, conservation of mass and linear momentum. Inviscid and Potential Flows: Uniform flow, source and sink, vortex, doublet, superposition of basic potential flows, half body, Rankine ovals, flow over circular cylinder. Viscous Flow: Navier-Stokes equation, flow between fixed parallel plates, Couette flow, steady, laminar flow in circular tubes, flow in annulus. Flow Over Immersed Bodies: Boundary layer characteristics, Prandtl/Blasius solution, momentum integral estimates, turbulent boundary layer flow, effects of pressure gradient, friction drag, pressure drag, lift. Compressible Flow: Ideal gas relationships, Mach number, types of compressible flow, isentropic flow of an ideal gas, converging-diverging duct flow, non-isentropic flow of ideal gas, Fanno and Rayleigh flow, normal shock waves. Turbomachines: Basic energy and angular momentum consideration, centrifugal pumps, pump performance curves and pump selection, dimensional parameters and similarity laws, impulse turbines, reactive turbines, compressors, compressible flow turbines, windmills.
