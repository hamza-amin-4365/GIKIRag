## Introduction
The ongoing process of globalization has significantly influenced sustainability, health, and environmental protection. As a result, capital structures are increasingly in need of a new breed of managers who can handle management risks and enable organizations to meet their objectives. In response to this need, the Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences & Technology (GIKI) offers a Master’s in Engineering Management (MEM) degree program. This program is designed to help engineers and technologists develop strong planning, decision-making, and managerial skills while enhancing their technical knowledge. 
The course outline is tailored to bridge accredited engineering programs with the necessary managerial skills to provide effective leadership in today’s multi-disciplinary business environments. The program primarily focuses on addressing leadership dilemmas and equipping students with the organizational and business skills required to navigate complex challenges. 
The MEM program is not just about technical expertise; it’s about building the skills needed to manage teams, projects, and lead organizations in a dynamic and competitive world. If you’re looking to enhance your ability to lead and manage effectively, this program is designed to serve your professional growth. 
## The Best of Business and Engineering
The MEM program offers a unique blend of business acumen and technical expertise, tailored specifically for professionals in the engineering field. Here’s what sets the program apart: 
  * Combines professional engineering practice with core business and management subjects.
  * Provides practical business perspectives needed by technical managers.
  * Equips students with comprehensive quantitative and analytical tools for decision-making.
  * Highlights skills specifically required in technology-based organizations, unlike traditional MBA programs.


## Course Work
The MS degree in Interfaculty Engineering Management Program consists of 7–8 courses. Three of these courses are mandatory core courses, while the remaining courses can be selected based on the student’s area of specialization in research topics for the MS thesis. The curriculum is designed to provide a solid foundation in both engineering and management, ensuring that students are well-prepared to lead in a variety of industries.
