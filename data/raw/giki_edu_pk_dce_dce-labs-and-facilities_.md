# Labs and Facilities of the Department of Civil Engineering
## **GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING LAB**
![geotechnical engineering lab](https://giki.edu.pk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/geotechnical-engineering-lab-300x200.jpg)The lab has one of the most advanced Triaxial testing machine and direct shear test machine. The lab also has the sufficient gear to analyze soil properties, their gradation, moisture values, and Atterburg’s limits. The constant and falling head apparatus is also present for the determination of permeability and the verification of Darcy’s law. The standard and modified proctor test equipment can be used to calculate the dry density as well as the bulk density of the soil for the optimum moisture content. The laboratory also contains field equipment; the standard penetration test apparatus, the speedy moisture kit, and the field density measuring equipment (Sand cone, core cutter, Balloon apparatus).

## **HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING**
![highway engineering lab](https://giki.edu.pk/dce/dce-labs-and-facilities/)This lab is used to test pavement materials, consisting of both the binder and the aggregates. The lab has the ability to perform the penetration and grading, flash and fire point, and ductility tests of bitumen on the one hand and on the other can be used to test the impact, abrasion, and fatigue resistance of the aggregates along with the flakiness index and the elongation numbers of aggregates. Plate load testing and California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test can be readily performed in the Lab.
