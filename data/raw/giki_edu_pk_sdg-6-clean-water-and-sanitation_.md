**Water Conservation Campaigns on campus**
Campaigns on water conservation are run along the campus. Water shortage is an alarmingly increasing global issue today. Many countries including Pakistan are to face serious water shortage by the year 2025! Clean & Green drive aimed to tackle this issue by igniting a positive change in our habits and successfully conducted a water conservation campaign around GIK campus, aiming to preserve even a small amount of water. Awareness stickers were pasted around basins, coolers and other water sources in the Institute.
**Cautious water usage on campus**
Time to time public service messages and awareness emails are sent to GIK community to avoid wastage of water.
**Less water absorption plant on campus**
You can design a landscape that conserves water as well as energy. The horticulture Department at GIK Institute has taken several measures to grow such plants and trees that consume less water and are drought resistant to conserve water on campus.
**Usage of water efficient appliances**
The Horticulture Department at GIK institute is using water sprinklers for watering the plants and lawns for conservation of water usage.
**Water recycling program implementation**
At GIK institute the rain & storm water is collected through different drain channels.
**Magical Noori-Clean drive Campaign GIK Adventure Club Oct 2023**
The one-day tour to Noori Waterfall organized by the GIK Adventure Club under the Department of Student Affairs beautifully exemplifies the principles of **SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**. The event highlighted the importance of preserving water sources and maintaining the natural beauty of our surroundings, while also providing an opportunity for participants to connect with the environment.
The **Clean Drive initiative** at the start of the tour directly aligned with SDG 6’s objective of improving water quality and safeguarding natural ecosystems. By cleaning the area surrounding the waterfall and throughout the hike, the participants helped prevent pollution and littering, which can directly impact local water bodies by causing contamination and disrupting ecosystems.
The adventure, which culminated in a visit to the stunning Noori Waterfall, underscored the significance of preserving such precious natural resources. Freshwater ecosystems, like the waterfall, play an essential role in providing clean water, supporting biodiversity, and maintaining environmental balance. Through this experience, participants were not only able to enjoy the beauty of the landscape but also gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of protecting our water sources.
Moreover, the tea served at the waterfall created a moment for reflection and dialogue about environmental stewardship and the need to protect vital water resources. This event was a meaningful blend of adventure, education, and environmental consciousness, all of which support the broader objectives of SDG 6 to ensure sustainable water management and reduce pollution in natural water systems.
Through this initiative, the GIK Adventure Club contributed to raising awareness about water conservation, environmental protection, and sustainable tourism, helping foster a sense of responsibility among participants for the future of our natural water resources.

**Clean GIK Drive and Hiking Trip by ASHRAE Society 16th Sept 2023**
The ASHRAE Society at GIK Institute’s clean drive and hiking trip on 16th September 2023 was a powerful initiative that not only brought students together but also had a meaningful impact on both the local environment and the broader goals of sustainability. The event perfectly aligns with **SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**, as it emphasized the importance of preserving natural environments—especially water sources and surrounding ecosystems—through collective action.
By engaging in a clean-up effort while hiking through the Institute and surrounding trails, the participants contributed directly to reducing pollution, which has a significant impact on water quality and overall ecosystem health. Clean water is not just about water bodies; it’s also about maintaining the surrounding environment, which impacts runoff, water filtration, and the overall balance of natural habitats.
The event showcased how small, localized actions—like cleaning up litter and promoting environmental stewardship—can have a ripple effect on broader sustainability goals. Through this initiative, the ASHRAE Society demonstrated that student-led efforts can contribute to the achievement of SDG 6, which focuses on ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
Such activities also inspire participants to adopt sustainable practices in their everyday lives, creating a ripple effect that can extend far beyond the campus and into communities, fostering a culture of environmental responsibility.

**Sanitary Kits Package Campaign Flood Donation by Women Engineering Society (WES)**
The flood relief campaign organized by the Women Engineering Society (WES) at GIK Institute in October 2022, in collaboration with the Mahwari Justice campaign, strongly resonates with the principles of SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. While the campaign directly addresses menstruation hygiene needs, its broader impact connects to ensuring access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene—especially in the aftermath of natural disasters like flooding.
The initiative focused on providing menstrual hygiene kits to young female flood victims in the flood-affected areas of Baluchistan, Southern Punjab, and KPK. Access to menstrual hygiene products is a critical aspect of maintaining dignity, health, and well-being, particularly in times of crisis when essential services like clean water and sanitation are often disrupted. By providing sanitary napkins, soap, and underwear, the WES and Mahwari Justice campaigns directly contributed to improving the hygiene conditions of vulnerable women and girls in these areas, supporting their right to clean sanitation facilities—an integral part of SDG 6.
Floods often lead to the contamination of water sources, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases, and creating urgent needs for sanitation and hygiene support. By distributing these kits, the campaign not only helped address menstrual health but also contributed to the overall goal of reducing health risks related to poor hygiene and lack of access to clean water and sanitation.
Moreover, the involvement of GIK Institute students in packaging the kits—around 700 kits in one day—showcased the power of community action and collective responsibility in responding to environmental and humanitarian challenges. This volunteer-driven effort reinforced the idea that access to basic sanitation and hygiene is not just a matter of convenience, but a critical part of ensuring health and safety for all, especially in crisis situations.
By addressing both the immediate and long-term needs of the affected communities, this campaign exemplified how grassroots efforts can play a key role in advancing SDG 6, particularly in terms of ensuring that vulnerable populations have the tools they need for **menstrual hygiene** and overall **sanitation** in the face of disaster.
