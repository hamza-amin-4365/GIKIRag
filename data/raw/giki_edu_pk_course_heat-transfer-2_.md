Introduction of Heat Transfer: Physical origins of conduction, convection and radiation, The conservation of energy. Conduction: The conduction rate equation, steady-state conduction in the plane wall and radial systems, conduction with thermal energy generation, finned surfaces, 2-D conduction: Shape factor, numerical methods, transient conduction: The lumped capacitance method. Convection: Boundary layers, laminar and turbulent flow, external flow convection, internal flow convection, The energy balance, free and forced convection. Heat Exchangers: Types, use of the LMTD method, The effectivenessâ€“NTU method. Radiation: Processes, radiation intensity, blackbody radiation, emission, absorption, reflection, and transmission by real surfaces, radiation exchange between surfaces, multi-mode heat transfer. Diffusion Mass Transfer: Physical origins and rate equations, mass transfer in non-stationary media, The stationary medium approximation, conservation of species for a stationary medium, homogeneous chemical reactions.
