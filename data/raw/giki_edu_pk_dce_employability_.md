Civil engineers play a vital role in delivering well-resourced, cost effective and timely construction of a variety of developmental projects from transport networks to Olympic stadia while ensuring that the integrity of the natural environment is unharmed.
The career prospects offered to graduates of civil engineering are also very diverse, from working as an engineering supervisor, surveyor, structural engineer, to employment as a 3d visualizer creating realistic animations and guidelines for construction teams.

Broadening into management, engineering research or professions that consider a qualification in economics and engineering management as an eligibility criterion for jobs can also offer a possibility of potential employment for civil engineers. Furthermore, globally the demand for qualified civil engineers has been upsurged thus increasing the employment opportunities in resource rich countries. 
As the civil engineering is a very broad area, there are many different specialty domains to consider for post graduate studies. Our degree will provide you a strong foundation for entering in any sub-area civil engineering.
