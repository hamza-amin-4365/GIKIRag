### **Funded Projects**
#### **Target Tracking From Up Above the Sky**
**Role:** PI  
**Funding Body:** HEC NRPU  
**Duration:** Two Years (2019 – 2020)  
**Total Budget :** About Rs. 2.6 M  
**Project Summary :** The use of surveillance cameras to monitor and track target(s) is currently an active area of research, with civil as well as in military applications. The conventional surveillance mechanisms, such as, pre-installed CCTV cameras, are static in nature and lack the capability to robustly monitor and track dynamic target(s) in a timely manner. In contrast, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), usually equipped with cameras and other sensors, adapt to fast changing environments in real-time with an accelerated search capability, and offer a superior target tracking and monitoring, resulting in a much more reliable and robust surveillance system. The proposed research work seeks to design and implement intelligent algorithms in the domain of cooperative aerial camera networks for surveillance and monitoring of moving targets. The general focus of the research work is to build up robust coordination and planning mechanisms to monitor and track following types of targets: 1) Isolated targets, e.g., using aerial cameras tp to track and monitor criminal targets, such as, suspicious vehicles moving on highways. 2) Targets in a cluttered environment, such as, human target(s) moving in the crowds or suspicious vehicles moving in heavy traffic.
#### **Artificial Intelligence Based Portable Microscopic Urine Sediment Analysis System**
**Role****:** Co-PI  
**Funding Body:** PSF-TUBITAK  
**Duration:** Three Years (2022 – 2025)  
**Total Budget:** About Rs. 50 M
**Project Summary****:** Urine sediment analysis is a critical diagnostic tool for patients with renal illnesses, providing insights into various kidney-related conditions. The microscopic examination of urine particles, including crystals, epithelial cells, red blood cells (RBC), bacteria, and white blood cells (WBC), plays a significant role in identifying renal abnormalities. This research project focuses on enhancing automated urine sediment analysis by using state-of-the-art deep learning based classification and detection algorithms, capable of detecting non-rectangular or non-circular shapes commonly found in microscopic urine sediments.
