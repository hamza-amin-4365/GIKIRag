## **Overview:**
GIK Institute is organizing the AI Spectrum Bootcamp 2025: From ML to LLMs & Beyond, a comprehensive four-week program designed to equip 50 STEM graduates with cutting-edge knowledge and hands-on expertise in artificial intelligence. Running from 28th July through 22nd August 2025, the Bootcamp offers 140 hours of immersive training covering the entire AI spectrum—from foundational machine learning and classical algorithms to advanced deep learning, computer vision, transformers, MLOps, diffusion models, and the latest generative AI technologies. The program aims to enable participants to build internationally competitive AI skills through intensive practical sessions and theory classes led by experts in the field. Details of the Bootcamp structure, curriculum, and schedule are outlined in the following sections.
## **Program Learning Outcomes**
  * Apply foundational **machine learning** techniques including **linear regression** , **logistic regression** , **supervised** and **unsupervised learning** , and classification tasks.
  * Develop, train, and optimize **neural networks** and ensemble models (**random forests** , **XGBoost**) using **TensorFlow** , incorporating regularization and bias-variance analysis.
  * Design and implement advanced **deep learning** architectures such as **fully connected** , **convolutional** , **recurrent networks** , and **vision transformers** with best practices including **batch normalization** , **dropout** , and hyperparameter tuning.
  * Employ state-of-the-art **computer vision** methods including **transfer learning** , **object detection** (**RCNNs** , **YOLO**), and **image segmentation** (**FCNs** , **U-Net** , **DeepLab**).
  * Implement and fine-tune **natural language processing** models using **Word2Vec** , **transformers** (**BERT** , **GPT**), and **LLM** finetuning for tasks such as **NER** and question answering.
  * Apply **MLOps** principles with tools like **Git** , **MLflow** , **Docker** , and **CI/CD** pipelines to enable reproducible and scalable ML workflows.
  * Develop and deploy **generative models** including **GANs** , **diffusion models** , **GPT** , **WaveGAN** , **Magenta** , **DALL-E** , **Whisper** , and **Gemini** for multimodal generation tasks.
  * Utilize **vision-language models** (**CLIP** , **BLIP** , **Flamingo**) for multimodal applications such as **image captioning** , **image-text retrieval** , and **visual question answering** (**VQA**).
  * Critically evaluate ethical, fairness, transparency, and safety issues in AI, promoting responsible AI development.
