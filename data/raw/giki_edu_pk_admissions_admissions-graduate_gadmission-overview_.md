###### Graduate Program
The Graduate Program at GIK Institute is ensured to be of international standards and will constitute a significant step towards reducing our reliance on advanced countries for higher training in the engineering sciences. The faculty, equipment, laboratories and library facilities provide easy access for the students to the latest corpus of knowledge in their fields of specialization. Our students may have opportunities to complete part of his/her studies at reputed universities abroad under the split degree program.
The GIK Institute graduate program is expected to be a major stride in the evolution of engineering education and research in the country and bringing about a qualitative change in this field. It is envisaged that this will promote productive liaison between the Institute and industry. The research component will focus mainly on the problems of national industry; will act as a conduit for the inflow of latest know-how because of the collaboration with universities and research organizations in the advanced countries. Hence the program will produce engineers and technologists who have the urge, the attitudes, and the skills to lead techno-industrial transformation of the country.
The GIK Institute has undertaken an exciting venture in engineering education and research of the highest order and provided to its students, facilities for professional training and growth for which studies at universities of advanced countries were considered indispensable. The Institute welcomes Graduate students to participate in this venture by joining one of its graduate programs.
