Masroor Hussain is a Professor of Data Science in Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering. He is HEC approved PhD supervisor, NCEAC program evaluator and a registered PEC Engineer. He had obtained his 1st professional degree (BS) in computer science from NUCES-FAST Lahore. After completing his BS he also pursued his MS degree program from the same institution with specialization in Artificial Intelligence. He obtained PhD degree in computational mechanics program from GIK Institute, Topi.
His area of interests includes adaptive meshing, data mining, data warehousing, finite element methods, neural networks and parallel computing. His major contributions for research are on ALE moving mesh scheme, handwriting analysis, mesh reordering and partitioning techniques, spatial temporal neural networks, and stabilized mixed finite element methods.
Prior to joining the GIK Institute, he worked in NeuroDyne Medical Corp (www.neumed.com) as a software engineer. He spent two years in Neume, where he developed the software for medical instruments. These instruments read the neuro-muscular movements of the human body and analysed them. In particular, he worked with photoelectric Plethysmograph (PPG) and EMG signals. He also served the Comsats Institute, Lahore as a visiting faculty in Fall 2003. After successfully defending his MS thesis, he joined GIK Institute from June 2004 as Research Associate. Since May 2011 he has joined the Institute as an Assistant Professor.
