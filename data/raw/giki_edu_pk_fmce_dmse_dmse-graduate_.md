### Graduate Program Exam Preparation
  * Applicants for admission in MS and PhD program in Materials Engineering, with background in Physics, Chemistry or engineering disciplines other than Materials Science and Engineering, will be required to appear in both the **general test** and **subject test**.


  * Note that **appearance in subject test is possible once the applicant has been successful in the general test**. Subject test is normally conducted on the same date (in the afternoon) as the general test.


  * For subject test in Materials Engineering, the following book may be consulted for preparation: 
  *     * **Fundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering** by William D. Callister, Jr., David G. Rethwisch, 2008 or later edition.


  * In addition to the book mentioned above any other introductory/basic book related to materials engineering may be consulted.
