**How Employer Survey results are used for Continuous Quality Improvement**
Like other surveys, once the Employer Survey data collection is closed, a report is made on the survey results, to identify areas of strengths and weaknesses. The report is then disseminated to the relevant faculties and departments and also shared with the institute’s management. The results of the survey are primarily used by the institute’s management to identify areas for improvement and take corresponding corrective actions. The Deans/HoDs also discuss the results in various internal meetings for improvement. It is a requirement of HEC from 2020 that the relevant faculties/departments and university management should provide an action plan against weak areas identified in the survey results. The action plan is shared with QEC by relevant offices and QEC then follows up on the corrective actions taken against the findings of the report.
