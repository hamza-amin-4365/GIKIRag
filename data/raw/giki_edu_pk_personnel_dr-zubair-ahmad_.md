**Academic and Professional Background**
* * *
Dr. Zubair Ahmad completed his Ph.D. in computer science (cyber security) under the supervision of Prof. Stefano Calzavara at the University of Venice, Italy in 2024. His research mainly focuses on security and privacy-related issues on the web, information flow analysis, web measurements, EU compliance regulations, GDPR, and the Internet of Things. He also attended the Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS) jointly organized by Boston University and the University of Oregon USA. In 2023, Dr. Zubair also worked as a visiting scholar with Secure Web Application Group (SWAG) under the supervision of Prof. Ben Stock at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security Germany. He was also the part of European Parliament VeUMEU 2022 to work on the EU AI Act.
Before that, Dr. Zubair obtained his master’s degree in Information and Communication Engineering from CQUPT Chongqing China in 2019 where he got the Outstanding Graduate award. During his master’s degree, He worked under the supervision of Prof. Rong Chai on the Internet of Things and Machine-to-Machine Communication. In Dec 2017, Dr. Zubair along with his team won the first cash prize for his business idea “PET WORLD” at the One Belt One Road Business Idea Challenge China. He was also the vice-president of the International Student Association CQUPT China. Along with that, He also received many other awards including the Best Performance award in the United States Academic Decathlon and the best research paper award in WOCC 2019. From 2013 to 2014, he worked at IPL I2c.Inc. as a field engineer. He also worked as a trainee engineer at Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) from 2014 to 2015.
