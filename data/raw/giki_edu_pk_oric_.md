# Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization – ORIC
**Office of Outreach and Enterprise – OOE** was formed at **GIK Institute** in July 2010; an attempt to provide better services to its students, alumni and industry. **OOE** was made responsible for industry relations, alumni relations, career counseling and placement of students, fund raising and business development activities, communication and marketing. **OOE** was involved also to propose, plan and execute any innovative ideas or initiatives to promote the Institute’s objectives.  
Later, on the directions by **Higher Education Commission – HEC, OOE** was converted into **Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization – ORIC** at **GIK Institute. ORIC** is operating on the same mandate with a lot more focus on Industry – Academia linkages and research collaborations.
