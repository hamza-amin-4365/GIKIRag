**Brief description of activities**
**GIK, DoST and KPITB sign MoU for establishing a Venture Capital Fund for the Development and Growth of Startups in KP**
The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute (GIKI), the Department of Science and Technology (DoST), and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Information Technology Board (KPITB) to establish a Venture Capital Fund for the development and growth of startups in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) directly supports Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): No Poverty.
This initiative aims to foster entrepreneurship, innovation, and economic growth by providing critical financial resources to emerging startups in the region, particularly in the technology and innovation sectors. By facilitating access to venture capital, the MoU helps create new business opportunities, promote job creation, and stimulate economic development, which are essential drivers of poverty reduction.
Startups play a key role in economic development, and by supporting these businesses, the partnership seeks to empower local entrepreneurs, especially in underdeveloped regions like KP. The fund will help address economic disparities, support sustainable business practices, and promote inclusive growth, ultimately contributing to poverty alleviation. Through this collaboration, GIKI, DoST, and KPITB are not only nurturing a thriving startup ecosystem but also working toward reducing inequalities and enhancing local economic opportunities, in alignment with SDG 1’s objective of eradicating poverty and promoting shared prosperity.

The proposed site is located at Parmoli. Parmoli is an existing cluster of 3 primary and 2 secondary TCF schools. A Primary Unit consists of six class rooms from KG to V (30/ classroom) and a Secondary Unit is consisted of five class rooms from Grade VI to X (36/ classroom).  
Parmoli is a thickly populated area where an existing TCF School – Shirin Sultan Dossa Campus XVII – is operating at its full capacity of 183 students since 2007. There is an increasing demand from the community for another Primary School. Therefore, TCF proposed construction of a primary school unit for build-cycle 2017-18 (academic session 2018-19) on the above-mentioned location.  
The site is in a rural area with mostly low to medium income households. This location has been selected by TCF based on a strategic assessment of the area to determine “need”, as well as TCF’s operational priorities. The region survey assessment considers existing number of schools, number of children of school going age, poverty level, site suitability and land assessment.

**How to Donate:**
  * **Fruit-seller’s son, TCF alumnus graduates from GIKI**


In a small, mud-brick house of Khuda ki Basti, a slum in Karachi, the power is out, mosquitos are buzzing around, and rainwater is seeping in through the roof. Muhammad Ahmad, a fruit-seller, smiles happily as he stacks up mangoes on his pushcart and shares,  
“With my earnings, it would not have been possible for me to put Asad through a good school, college and university,” shares Ahmad. He leads us to the veranda where we join his wife and children who are waiting on a charpoy. He continues, “I had to drop out of school at a young age to support my family. It is my dream to educate all my children and TCF is making it possible.”
![](https://giki.edu.pk/sdgiki/sdg-1-no-poverty/)  
**“In our community, boys are expected to take up full-time jobs at a young age but Baba (father) encouraged me to focus on my education,”** shares Asad, a TCF school and college alumnus. **“When I was leaving for university, he handed me some money for my living expenses which he had been saving to get our roof fixed. When I hesitated, he told me: The repairing of our home can wait but this opportunity might not come again.”**  
Asad, who graduated from the prestigious Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, is ready to begin his first job at a software company. Two of his younger siblings, Saad and Sadia, are currently first-year students at TCF College while his two other sisters, Haadiya and Tooba are studying in Classes 9 and 7 at the TCF school in their community – all of whom have big dreams of their own!
