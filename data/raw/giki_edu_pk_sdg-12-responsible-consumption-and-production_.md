**1st International Conference on Climate Change and Emerging Trends in Civil Engineering (CPD)** The Ghulam Ishaq Khan (GIK) Institute recently hosted the 1st International Conference on Climate Change and Emerging Trends in Civil Engineering, bringing together experts, researchers, and participants to address pressing issues of sustainability in the field of civil engineering. This conference focused on productive research into sustainable development topics, including waste management, with the goal of developing forward-thinking solutions that meet the unique needs of the twenty-first century. By discussing the 3R concept: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle the conference highlighted critical approaches to waste management, emphasizing the need to reduce waste production in construction, reuse materials wherever feasible to extend their lifecycle, and recycle to transform waste into new resources rather than letting it contribute to environmental degradation. Through such discussions, the organizers and participants generated actionable insights and scenarios that align with global sustainability goals, equipping them with strategies to design greener, more resilient infrastructure for a rapidly changing world.
**IMPROVE WATER QUALITY, WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND SAFE REUSE**
GIKI improve water quality. By lowering pollution, doing away with dumping, avoiding the release of dangerous chemicals and materials, halving the amount of untreated wastewater, and significantly increasing recycling and safe reuse internationally. Used water is treated from a sewerage plant and then sent to water canals from where it is used for crop irrigation.
The sewage treatment plant of GIK Institute is located outside the campus, near the WAPDA check post. After treatment, the effluent is disposed of into the Indus River. Plant can handle 0.2 million gallons/day. Treatment is done in seven stages, where different types of equipment are installed. The existing plant is in operational since 1993.
Further details can be found on the following link: 
**Separate garbage cans:**
Waste segregation, as mandated by law, is essential for efficient recycling because it streamlines the sorting process, making it easier and more cost-effective to recycle materials while significantly reducing landfill waste. This practice benefits both public health and the environment by minimizing pollution and conserving resources. At the GIK Institute, the administration has embraced this approach by installing separate bins for plastic, glass, and paper throughout the campus. This infrastructure encourages students and staff to participate in the 3R recycling principles: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. By segregating waste effectively, the institute reduces the volume of non-recyclable waste, facilitates the reuse of materials where possible, and ensures that sorted recyclables like plastic, glass, and paper can be properly recycled. This system not only promotes an eco-friendly campus but also aligns with broader sustainability goals by reducing waste, cutting down disposal costs, and fostering a cleaner, healthier environment for all.
**Industrial Waste Management**
At the Ghulam Ishaq Khan (GIK) Institute, the Industrial Waste Management course provides students with essential knowledge and practical skills to manage waste sustainably in industrial settings, connecting deeply with the 3R principles Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Through this course, students explore methods to reduce waste at its source, emphasizing waste minimization strategies in production processes. They also examine innovative approaches to reuse materials, highlighting opportunities to repurpose byproducts within the industrial cycle to avoid unnecessary disposal. Finally, the course covers advanced recycling technologies that enable students to understand how to recycle industrial waste effectively, transforming what would otherwise be pollutants into valuable resources. By integrating the 3R concept into industrial waste management practices, this course prepares GIK graduates to create sustainable, eco-friendly solutions that minimize environmental impact while promoting efficiency and conservation within the industrial sector.
**Ban on using plastic bags on campus**
The GIK Institute actively promotes environmentally friendly practices in alignment with the 3R recycling principles: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Recognizing the harmful impact of plastic bags on the environment, the institute has implemented a ban on plastic bags at all campus grocery stores. This policy reduces the consumption of single-use plastics, significantly cutting down on waste that would otherwise contribute to pollution. In response, most residents bring eco-friendly tote bags when shopping at the campus’s Tuc area, an excellent example of reusing durable alternatives that can be used multiple times, replacing the need for disposable plastic bags. By fostering a culture that discourages wasteful single-use plastics, GIK Institute not only supports sustainable campus life but also encourages broader habits of conservation and recycling among its community members, advancing toward a cleaner, greener environment.
**Water recycling program (2) implementation:**
At GIK institute the rain & storm water is collected through different drain channels. Some of existing storm water drains on campus are shown below. This water is then reused for irrigation. Some of the water is stored in water tanks installed on rooftops of the buildings which is then used in toilets for flushing. Water tanks are also installed on mountain areas where rainwater is collected and then this water is utilized for green spaces watering. GIK Institute has a functional sewage plant that filters the sewage water into re-useable water which is thrown into canal water system and used for irrigation in nearby crops by local farmers.
**Inorganic waste disposal for recycling:**
All the inorganic waste is dumped in separate labeled garbage cans and bins which is then collected and separated (plastic, paper, glass) by the staff and this waste is then handed over to the local administration for proper disposal at their own dumping sites from where it is sent for recycling.
**Organic waste collected by local farmers:**
The Institute also has arrangements to involve the local farmer in collecting organic waste for their cattle or livestock usage such as plant/herbs waste. The costs of growing livestock feed are increasing due to rising fuel and fertilizer costs and the increasing frequency of extreme weather conditions. For effective use of waste produced by the Institute and to help local farmers in the vicinity, they are allowed to take organic waste for their cattle from the campus. Using food waste in livestock feeds can help poor local farmers reduce feed costs and help Institute reduce disposal costs while minimizing the environmental impacts of this waste.
**Recycling/Upcycling of leaves and plants waste into fertilizer:**
At the Ghulam Ishaq Khan (GIK) Institute, the practice of recycling and upcycling leaves and plant waste into fertilizer exemplifies a commitment to sustainable waste management in alignment with the 3R principles Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Instead of allowing organic waste to contribute to landfills, the institute transforms this waste into valuable fertilizer, effectively reducing the overall volume of waste generated on campus. This process not only reuses the nutrients from plant materials but also enriches the soil for campus plantations, promoting a greener environment. By recycling leaves and plant waste into fertilizer, GIK enhances its sustainability efforts while supporting healthy plant growth throughout the campus. This initiative underscores the institute’s dedication to eco-friendly practices and its role in cultivating a culture of sustainability within the community.
**Awareness campaigns – “World Food Day” A Public Service Message from Student Affairs Department**
World Food Day is observed annually on 16 October to highlight the millions of people worldwide who cannot afford a healthy diet and the need for regular access to nutritious food. We need to build a sustainable world where everyone, everywhere has regular access to enough nutritious food. Many of us have a very bad habit of food waste. Buying more food than we need, letting fruits and vegetables spoil at home or taking larger portions than we can eat. Let this be an opportunity to advise you all that “Do Not Waste food. Let this be a day and onwards to also spread the word ‘Not to Waste Food”. Let’s be responsible people.
خوراک کا عالمی دن ہر سال 16 اکتوبر کو منایا جاتا ہے. حالیہ” سیلاب سے آنے والی تباہی کو مد نظر رکھتے ہوئے ہمیں خوراک کے بے جا ضیاع سے بچنا ہے تاکہ ہر شخص کے لئے خوراک کی مسلسل فراہمی کو یقینی بنایا جا سکے “۔

**Leftover food from central mess and cafeteria**
At the GIK Institute, leftover food from the central mess and cafeteria is efficiently managed through a well-established waste reduction and recycling system aligned with the 3Rs—Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Through mindful practices encouraged among students and staff, food waste at the source is reduced significantly. For leftovers that cannot be avoided, reuse initiatives are in place, directing edible portions toward donation programs or animal feed, contributing to local sustainability efforts. Non-edible food scraps are then recycled through a composting process, transforming organic waste into nutrient-rich compost. This compost is used in campus gardens, enriching the soil naturally and reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers. This circular approach not only helps divert waste from landfills but also fosters an eco-conscious campus environment, demonstrating the institute’s commitment to sustainability.
  1. **Paperless office environment use of E-office at GIK institute:**


The Ghulam Ishaq Khan (GIK) Institute has initiated a Program for Reducing Paper Use on Campus, aiming to transition toward a paperless office environment wherever possible. As part of this initiative, a dedicated committee has been constituted to streamline the process of recognizing emails as official correspondence, minimizing the need for physical documentation. The committee’s responsibilities include assessing the feasibility of e-filing software and digital applications that can facilitate secure, accessible, and efficient document management. Additionally, the committee will evaluate various digital tools that support electronic approvals, enhancing convenience while reducing paper reliance. Within a week, the committee is expected to submit comprehensive recommendations, detailing practical steps for implementation and addressing any infrastructure needs or training requirements to promote a sustainable, paperless culture across campus. This program not only aligns with the institute’s environmental goals but also advances operational efficiency by modernizing documentation practices.
**Ban on using plastic bags on campus:**
GIK Institute promotes environmentally friendly practices which includes ban on use of plastic bags at all grocery stores on campus due to their negative impact on the environment.

**Availability of eco-friendly tote bags in grocery stores on campus:**
The Ghulam Ishaq Khan (GIK) Institute has launched a Campus Paper Reduction Program aimed at fostering a sustainable, eco-friendly environment by reducing paper usage across campus operations. This program promotes a transition to reusable and digital alternatives wherever possible, inspired by the successful use of eco-friendly tote bags at the campus’s Tuc area, where residents already embrace reusability. Like these tote bags purchased, used, and returned for reuse at grocery stores the program will focus on adopting digital tools and applications that minimize paper dependence, especially for official documentation and correspondence.
**Reusing back-side of paper for printing on one sided printed sheet:**
In many offices within campus, it is practiced that one-sided printed papers are reused again for printing purposes.
**Back-to-back printing:**
In offices inside campus, back-to-back printing is encouraged to reduce the no. of papers usage.
**Metal cutlery used in cafeteria and mess:**
To avoid the use of plastic metal cutlery is used in cafeteria and mess instead of plastic spoons etc.
**Water served in Water coolers, pitchers, and Jugs**
To discourage the use of plastic water bottles the water in cafeteria is served in jugs, pitchers and coolers are also placed to drinking water.
**Refill dispensers for liquid soap and sanitizers:**
Instead of purchasing separate plastic bottles for sanitizers and liquid soaps, refilling dispensers are installed all around campus that are refilled on a regular basis by purchasing in bulk.
**Cleaning cloth available at main store:**
Instead of using synthetic sponges or scrubbers, cotton cloth for cleaning and dusting purposes are available at GIK Main store that are used in offices and faculties for cleaning.
**ERP initiative for paperless office work:**
A new initiative has been introduced via ERP Campus management system deployment through which paper usage would be reduced.
**Use of GIK Institute labeled crockery in mess, offices, and cafeteria:**
To avoid usage of disposable plates and crockery items, GIK Institute uses its own crockery with its own printed labels which can be washed and reused.
**Lab Chemical Waste:**
At GIK Institute, particularly within the Faculty of Materials and Chemical Engineering, the management of toxic and hazardous wastes is approached with the utmost care and responsibility. These materials, generated from various research activities, are stored in designated collection areas designed to prevent contamination and ensure safety. The temporary waste storage facilities are equipped with advanced containment systems that minimize risks to both human health and the environment. Regular monitoring and strict adherence to regulatory guidelines are maintained to ensure that these hazardous substances are disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner. The institute prioritizes sustainability by collaborating with certified waste disposal companies that specialize in handling toxic materials, thereby ensuring that the waste is treated and disposed of without posing any threat to local ecosystems or communities. This comprehensive approach not only safeguards the environment but also serves as a model for responsible waste management practices in academic research settings.
**Health Care waste:**
According to WHO, of the total amount of waste generated by health-care activities, about 85% is general, non-hazardous waste. The remaining 15% are considered hazardous material that may be infectious, toxic or radioactive. Every year an estimated 16 billion injections are administered worldwide, but not all of the needles and syringes are properly disposed of afterwards. Open burning and incineration of health care wastes can, under some circumstances, result in the emission of dioxins, furans, and particulate matter.
Measures to ensure the safe and environmentally sound management of health care wastes can prevent adverse health and environmental impacts from such waste including the unintended release of chemical or biological hazards, including drug-resistant microorganisms, into the environment thus protecting the health of patients, health workers, and the public.
At GIK Institute we dispose of the health-care waste with proper approval of the Head Medical Center GIK Institute to the safe disposing sites.
