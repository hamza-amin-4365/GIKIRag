Introduction
### Electromagnetics Research Group
Electromagnetics Research Group (ERG) of GIKI conducts research over a broad range of topics, both fundamental and applied. Applied research includes the design of microwave frequency selective structures, Tunable Metamaterials. Further research includes analytical study of Chiral and Chiral Nihility waveguides, Cassegrain and Gregorian Systems, Fractional electromagnetics, wave propagation in Bi-isotropic media, wave propagation in Complex Fractal media and advanced antenna design. Fundamental research is primarily concerned with developing rigorous computational methods for the analysis of fields across the electromagnetic spectrum. These methods include novel discretization techniques, fast methods in the frequency and time domains, and multistage analysis. This group performs numerical simulations in advanced softwares like Agilent ADS, HFSS and for analytical solution analysis, MATLAB, MATHCAD and MATHEMATICA software tools are used.
