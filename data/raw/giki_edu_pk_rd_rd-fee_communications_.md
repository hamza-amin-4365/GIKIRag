Introduction
### Communications and Signal Processing Research Group
Communication and Signal Processing Research (CSPR) group of GIKI conducts research over both fundamental and applied topics. In the applied domain, the group concentrates on the topics including energy efficiency in hybrid mobile and wireless communication networks, 3G and beyond mobile systems, mesh and ad hoc networks, traffic engineering in wireless networks, performance evaluation of communication protocols and networks by analysis and simulation, and quality of service in wireless networks. Theoretical aspects are also explored in the field of signal processing, cognitive radio network, green wireless communication, etc.
For the numerical evaluation of the analytical solutions of the problems researched by the group, softwares like Matlab and Mathematica are used. For the simulation purposes, state-of-the-art simulation softwares like NS3, Glomosim, and OPNET++ are used.
