**_MS Thesis_**
**Lyapunov Neural Network-based Adaptive Inverse Control for Tracking of Unknown MIMO Nonlinear Systems**
The thesis proposes a direct model-free neuro-adaptive tracking controller using a novel fast gradient-free Lyapunov stable machine learning recurrent neural network (LSMRN) algorithm applicable to invertible input-output stable dynamic systems. This controller processes the plant input and output signals data for synthesizing the adaptive tracking control effort without using the model structure and the system parameters.
The key contributions are twofold: reducing computational complexity by replacing the traditional neural network estimator (NNE) and controller (NNC) with a single recurrent neural network, and significantly improving tracking performance. The LSMRN relies solely on input/output data, eliminating the need for explicit system models and control signal estimators in the closed loop. Lyapunov stability analysis ensures closed-loop stability and error convergence. Simulations on the Lorenz Chaotic and 3D Chaotic Satellite systems demonstrate the controller’s superior tracking accuracy with reduced control effort, highlighting its robustness and efficiency compared to conventional methods.
