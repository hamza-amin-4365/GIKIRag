A regular semester is saturated with various sports events such as cricket championship, indoor/outdoor football tournament, chess tournament, basketball tournament, hockey matches and table tennis competitions. All these events make the student life worthwhile amid tough academic environment. These events are fondly watched by a large number of spectators at GIK.
###### Sports Leagues
* * *
Besides the general sports, there is also a proper league system for the games of cricket and football (soccer) in GIK.  
Both the cricket and football leagues are properly organized, hold well set tournaments and matches that are often in a professional pool format. Due to the academic requirements during daylight hours, these matches are often held at night under floodlights, which further adds to the charm of these thrilling events.  
It is considered to be an honour to be part of any of the teams participating in the leagues and the winners are admired and respected by the student body.
