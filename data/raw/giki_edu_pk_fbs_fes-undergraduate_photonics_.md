Photonics and Microelectronics lies at the heart of modern tech from personal electronics, autonomous vehicles, smart phones, modern lasers, communications, imaging & displays, and solar cells. This area deals with the study, development, and deployment of the electronic and photonic devices that generate, transmit, detect, and process electrical and electromagnetic energy and information. Advances in developing photonic devices and an improved understanding of the underlying physical principles (quantum electronics and nonlinear optics) have led to reliable and increasingly sophisticated applications in optical communications, displays, solid state lighting, sensors and medicine. The effect of such advances has revolutionized the electronics and photonics industries and continues to play a significant role in the modern engineering profession.
Applications of photonics and microelectronics are ubiquitous. Included are all areas from everyday life to the most advanced science and engineering, e.g., solar cells, light detection, telecommunications, information processing, photonic computing, lighting, metrology, spectroscopy, holography, medicine, biophotonics, military technology, laser material processing, art diagnostics, agriculture, and robotics.
