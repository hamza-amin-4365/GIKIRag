**Equal Opportunities for all**
**Fruit-seller’s son, TCF alumnus graduates from GIKI**
In a small, mud-brick house of Khuda ki Basti, a slum in Karachi, the power is out, mosquitos are buzzing around, and rainwater is seeping in through the roof. Muhammad Ahmad, a fruit-seller, smiles happily as he stacks up mangoes on his pushcart and shares,  
“With my earnings, it would not have been possible for me to put Asad through a good school, college and university,” shares Ahmad. He leads us to the veranda where we join his wife and children who are waiting on a charpoy. He continues, “I had to drop out of school at a young age to support my family. It is my dream to educate all my children and TCF is making it possible.”

**“In our community, boys are expected to take up full-time jobs at a young age but Baba (father) encouraged me to focus on my education,”** shares Asad, a TCF school and college alumnus. **“When I was leaving for university, he handed me some money for my living expenses which he had been saving to get our roof fixed. When I hesitated, he told me: The repairing of our home can wait but this opportunity might not come again.”**  
Asad, who graduated from the prestigious Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, is ready to begin his first job at a software company. Two of his younger siblings, Saad and Sadia, are currently first-year students at TCF College while his two other sisters, Haadiya and Tooba are studying in Classes 9 and 7 at the TCF school in their community – all of whom have big dreams of their own!
