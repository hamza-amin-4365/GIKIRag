Through a network spanning across 6,500 square kilometers, KE supplies power to all residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural areas that fall under the city’s ambit and beyond. KE is the only vertically-integrated power utility in Pakistan managing all three key areas – Generation, Transmission and Distribution – of producing and delivering energy to customers.

As a forward-looking utility, KE embraces innovation and looks to embed it in its organizational functions by providing a platform for problem solving. KE seeks to engage with entrepreneurs, startups, researchers, and university students to identify talent and ideas that could address the challenges faced by Pakistan’s energy market, while also recognizing opportunities for innovation in this sector.
  
The top 3 participants of the KE 7/11+ Innovation Challenge will receive a collective sum of PKR 3 Million (PKR 1.5 Million, PKR 750,000, and PKR 750,000 respectively) as prize money.
