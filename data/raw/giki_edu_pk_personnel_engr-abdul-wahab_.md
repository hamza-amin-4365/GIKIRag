### Engr. Abdul Wahab 
Lecturer
## Qualifications: 
MS Chemical Engineering (GIKI)
## Research Interests:
Photocatalysis, Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to valuable solar fuels, Photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting, Photocatalytic water treatment
Engr. Abdul Wahab has worked with Dr. Khurram Imran of Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (GIKI), Topi, for two years on photocatalytic CO2 reduction to valuable solar fuels and photocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting. While staying at GIKI, he got hands-on experience in catalytic materials synthesis and characterization. He synthesized catalysts using precipitation, co-precipitation, and hydrothermal methods. For characterization of materials, he utilized X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), surface properties analysis through Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and optical properties analysis through UVâ€“vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). He is interested in synthesizing novel catalysts based on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and layered double hydroxide (LDH) to optimize hydrogen production through water splitting. He is curious to understand the reaction mechanisms on catalyst surfaces and develop industrially viable catalysts using that knowledge.
