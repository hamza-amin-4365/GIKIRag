## **Post Graduate Studies**
Realizing the importance of graduate studies for addressing the design and construction issues, coping with new challenges of modern construction trends, and the need for continuing education/research in the current competitive environment, GIK Institute, Topi has decided to launch MS and Ph.D. program in Civil Engineering capitalizing upon the already well-established state of the art infrastructure for undergraduate studies at the campus.
Towards this end, the GIK Institute, Topi has already taken important measures to prepare for the launch of this graduate program. The measures include the hiring of foreign-qualified Ph.D. faculty (refer to Faculty Strength), upgradation of the existing lab infrastructure, enhancement in the library collection of textbooks and scientific journals, and expansion in the instructional and research space on the campus.
## **Course Work**
MS Program: The requirement is a minimum of 24 credit hours of coursework and 06 credit hours of thesis involving research work.
### **MS Program:**
The requirement is a minimum of 24 credit hours of coursework and 06 credit hours of thesis involving research work.

*** With the permission of the advisor and approval by HoD.**
###  **Ph.D. Program** :
The requirement is a minimum of 18 credit hours of coursework beyond the master’s course work along with a dissertation of eighteen credit hours and at least two research-oriented papers in international journals. The courses to be taken up by a student will be decided by the student’s Ph.D. Guidance Committee and approved by the Dean of Graduate School. Out of eight courses, at least five must be from the list of DCvE courses and the remainder from other faculties. (The program is planned to be verified by HEC within a period of six months).
