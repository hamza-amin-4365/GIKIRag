  * **Intrinsic dimensionality estimation in Hyperspectral Images**


Hyperspectral Images (HSI) form an important component of modern remote sensing. These images consist of a number of spectral bands, unlike the commonly known RGB images which consist of only three spectral bands, and hence provide useful information about the characteristics of the materials which are being imaged. HSI are capture via satellites, airplanes as well as UAVs, and are used in a number of applications such as land mapping, vegetation and water monitoring, surveillance, target detection, cancer detection etc. One of the most important information extracted from a digital hyperspectral image is the estimation of the number of end-members/materials present in an image, which is also known as the intrinsic dimensionality estimation problem. In this project the student will work on novel signal processing techniques to determine the intrinsic dimensionality in the hyperspectral image.

HSI are capture via satellites, airplanes as well as UAVs, and are used in a number of applications such as land mapping, vegetation and water monitoring, surveillance, target detection, cancer detection etc. Deep learning has recently become the preferred method for inferring useful information from a real hyperspectral image. In this project, the student will apply recent developments from the deep learning community for important information extraction tasks in hyperspectral images, such as classification, unmixing and intrinsic dimensionality estimation.
  * **Machine learning for physical layer wireless communication algorithms**


Wireless communication has revolutionized our way of communications and many of the everyday communication technologies belong to this genre, e.g. WiFi, 4G, etc. One of the latest trends in the research area of wireless communications is the application of machine learning techniques for the various signal processing tasks at the physical layer such as channel estimation, adaptive modulation and coding etc. In this project, the student will make use of new developments from the machine learning community and apply them for optimization tasks at the physical layer of wireless communications.
  * **Reconstruction algorithms for Compressed Sensing**


Compressed Sensing is a relatively new area in the area of signal processing where the sparsity of the underlying signal is exploited in order to come up with better algorithms for signal estimation. Reconstruction algorithms aim to recover the original signal from the compressed signal in which the number of available samples are less than the Nyquist limit. Different algorithms have been devised for the reconstruction purposes, such as Bayesian algorithms, iterative thresholding algorithms etc. In this project different reconstruction algorithms will be analyzed for reconstruction purposes and improvements will be devised for their usage in a particular application e.g. hyperspectral images.

Study of our Universe is by no means an easy task. The complex astrophysical phenomena involved makes the problem very challenging and indeed knowhow of basic sciences, engineering, modeling and simulation is the minimal requirement for a better understanding of our Universe. The nucleosynthesis problem (r-, s-, p- and rp-processes), evolution phases of stars and supernova explosions are few astrophysical phenomena that require microscopic calculation of weak interaction rates at high temperatures (of the order of billions of kelvin) and high densities (of the order of 1011 g/cm3). Besides we also need calculation of other input data before we can run the mega codes on supercomputers to model these phenomena.
Our group is part of a world-wide effort to microscopically calculate the inputs for these simulation and modeling codes. The group is mainly concerned with the calculation of nuclear data. The results are then given to collaborators running the simulation codes. Various nuclear models (e.g. QRPA, shell model) are employed to calculate the inputs. Numerical techniques, computer programming and understanding of the physical phenomena are the basic requirements in our group. The group also uses other models like Potential Model and R-Matrix to calculate astrophysical S-factors and proton capture rates.
Experimental work is done in collaboration with other experimental groups. This include renewable energy technologies.
**Research Topics:**
  * Calculation of β-decay half-lives for exotic nuclei.
  * Calculation of allowed Gamow-Teller, Fermi and forbidden charge-changing transitions.
  * Calculation of weak-interaction mediated rates in stellar conditions.
  * Calculation of nuclear partition functions, nuclear level densities and nuclear abundances.
  * r-, s-, p- and rp-process calculations.
  * Double beta decay calculations (two-neutrino and neutrinoless modes)
  * Use of pn-QRPA, Shell model, Pyatov method, Schematic Model and other nuclear models to microscopically calculate the nuclear data.
  * Astrophysical S-factor and proton capture rates.
  * Mass abundance computations
  * Fuel cells, PVs, semitransparent thermoelectric and semitransparent photo-thermoelectric cells

  * **A key approach to anomalous diffusion by deterministic and stochastic processes**


In real-world problems, diffusion of matter and heat is a widely well-known phenomenon.. Therefore, in the realm of normal and anomalous diffusion, deterministic processes play a vital role in the investigation of microscopic properties of non-trivial systems (stochastic) and leave many unanswered questions. Such properties are invisible but yet to investigate by simple toy models.
The proposed research project is focused on the development of deterministic dynamics to investigate the elusive properties of stochastic processes such as Levy-Lorentz gas, Levy walk, and CTRW.

  * **Classification of Raman Spectra Collected from Dangerous Materials**


Raman spectroscopy is a powerful non-contact technique that uses a laser to probe the vibrational energy levels of molecules in a substance. The vibration Information provided by a Raman spectrum is very specific for the chemical composition of the molecules. The spectrum can therefore provide unique Signature for identification of vapor traces from various materials. The proposed research work will focus on developing adaptive and intelligent classification schemes for Raman spectra collected at a stand-off distance from dangerous materials. Applications include safety and security.
  * **Fundamental Frequency Estimation for Biomedical Signal Processing**


Estimation of time-varying fundamental frequency is an important problem in many real-life applications, e.g. analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure signals. Instantaneous fundamental frequency of such signals is usually estimated by first windowing a signal and then applying methods such as non-linear least square. However, this approach is approach is based on an assumption that a given signal is stationary within an observation time. Research under this topic will focus on efficiently handling the non-stationarity.
