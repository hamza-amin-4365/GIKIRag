Initially, the library was housed in the Faculty of Metallurgy and Material Engineering (Now Material Science & Engineering). The construction of the main library building was started and completed in 1996. It is a stately three-story building, set against the background of brooding and austere hills of Tarbela Dam, that now houses the Central Library of the Institute. Its interior design, decor, and furniture create an atmosphere of an intellectual sanctuary wherein the students and faculty can concentrate on their studies. Its vast collection comprises of books, eBooks, Journals & eJournals and audiovisual materials. The library provides 18 hours of access every day and is open around the clock during examinations. Furthermore, it also provides desktop access to different e-databases, GIK eBooks, and library catalogs to all the campus readers on their desks.
The library also offers a Wi-Fi facility for access to the internet, a furnished seminar room, and is fully air-conditioned. In order to facilitate sharing resources through inter-library loans and exchange of database information, it is electronically linked with all of the prominent institutions of science and technology in the country. The GIK Institute Library also maintains its own portal where you can find all the latest information about the library collections, Digital Library access, and much more.
