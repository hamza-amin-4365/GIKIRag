Research Interests:
**Habib Bank (HBL) Center for Blockchain & Applied Research**
Established the HBL Center for Blockchain & Applied Research in 2023, which is the first industry-academia partnership of its kind and is the foremost research center in the country dedicated to harness the expertise of academics in futuristic technologies of blockchain, machine learning and cyber-security, for addressing industry-proposed problems. This landmark agreement provided a much needed template for industry-academia partnerships.
Currently, researchers are working on developing cross border remittance application, tokenization of financial instruments, blockchain performance evaluation framework and other exciting areas.
**OGDCL Clean Energy Research Center**
Established the OGDCL Clean Energy Research Center in 2024, which is one of the largest industrial funding in the history of Pakistan, sponsored by the Oil and Gas Development Corporation (OGDCL). Researchers are working towards building an ecosystem of expertise in Green Hydrogen.
Major milestones involve developing a Solar Hydrogen energy system with an aim to lead the transition in Pakistan towards a sustainable future in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Researchers will also work on electrochemical reduction of CO2, purification of wastewater, Artificially Intelligent Load management, Blockchain-based Energy trading and other emerging trends in clean technologies.   
This venture is a step towards advancing sustainable energy solutions and meeting the UN SDG Targets in Pakistan. The research innovative technology promises to revolutionize our energy landscape, offering a reliable and eco-friendly solution to meet our growing energy needs while reducing carbon emissions.   

Dr. Fahd is currently working on a host of exciting and cutting edge interdisciplinary projects focused around sustainable ENERGY in line with the United Nation’s (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 7.
