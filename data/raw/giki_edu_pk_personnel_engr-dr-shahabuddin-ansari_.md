###### AIM Lab
* * *
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) lab has been involved in quality research work in medical diagnostics and treatment using medical imaging and Artificial Intelligence (AI) since 2010. The lab has won a number of grants from Directorate of Science and Technology (DoST), KPK, and HEC, Pakistan. A grant of amount PKR480,000 from DoST was acquired for the implementation of automatic classification of prostate cancer tissues using wavelet packet transformation using histological images. Another project, on automatic segmentation of subcortical regions using nonlinear warping technique on brain MRIs was published in a FIT conference in 2010. In 2017, the lab also received a HEC grant of PKR452,300 for brain image analysis with tumors using AI techniques. Recently, a HEC-NRPU grant of PKR 1.1 million has been acquired for the characterization of Alzheimer’s disease in MRI images using deep neural networks. The lab has also been involved in various digital image processing based and hardware-based final year projects for undergraduate students.
