## Research Experience
* * *
**1. Research Assistant (RA), SEDS-2021003**  
• Worked on a research project with the title “Analytical and numerical methods for solving catalytic reactions and transport problems for porous pellets and membrane reactors with controlled catalyst activity.”  
• This research project aimed to study the formation of dead zones in the catalytic flow-through membrane reactors and to investigate the performance of such reactors in series and series-parallel reactions with power-law kinetics of fractional order.
**2. Research Assistant (RA), IRN-AP19676969**  
• The title of this project was “Developing a Numerical Algorithm to Prevent the Dead-Zone Formation in Flow-Through Catalytic Membrane Reactors”.  
• This research aimed to propose a bisection algorithm to compute relevant membrane velocity and suppress the formation of undesired dead zones effectively.  
• Moreover, the research focused on investigating the impact of the Thiele modulus and reaction exponent on dead-zone length and its successful suppression.
