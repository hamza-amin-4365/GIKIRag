**Introduction to Soft Computing  
** | **Hours: 3 0 3**  
---|---  
The course provides an in-depth overview of the theoretical and the practical aspects of the soft computing paradigm. The main focus is on the theory and application of probabilistic graphical models (commonly known as Bayesian networks in the Artificial Intelligence community) and related topics, such as, knowledge elicitation issues, belief updating in singly and multiply connected networks, simulation schemes for belief updating, parameter and structure learning of Bayesian networks, and integration of time and uncertainty. Alternative models of uncertain reasoning (including belief function theory and fuzzy logic) and biologically inspired computational models (neural networks and evolutionary algorithms) are also presented.
