### Publication
WRE 2020 seeks original book chapters on any topic listed above. Book chapters accepted after a double-blind review process will be published by the CRC Press (Taylor & Francis Group, USA) as a book series (Computer in Engineering Design and Manufacturing Series). 
### No registration or public fee for authors
The Financial Sponsor of WRE 2020 will cover all costs of the Workshop. No registration or publication fee will be charged to the authors of the accepted chapters. However, one of the authors of an accepted book chapters must register and present the work at WRE 2020 in order for their chapter to be included in the book series. The travel, boarding and lodging costs of all registered authors (only one author per accepted book chapter) will also be borne by WRE 2020 financial sponsor. Registration for authors and participants will be available through this website at a later stage
