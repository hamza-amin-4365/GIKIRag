#### Introduction
The institute values the opinion of its alumni and their opinion is sought via the alumni survey  
conducted each year. Whereas all the alumni are invited to provide their opinion and  
suggestions, the alumni graduated in the recent 5 years are especially followed-up to  
provide their responses.
#### How Alumni Survey results are used for Continuous Quality Improvement
Like other surveys, once the alumni survey data collection is closed, a report is made on the  
survey results, to identify areas of strengths and weaknesses. The alumni survey report is  
then disseminated to the respective departments/faculties, as well as the institute’s  
management.
**The results of the survey are primarily used for two purposes in GIKI:**
  1. By the management to see areas which require improvement and take corresponding  
actions. It is a requirement of HEC from 2020 that the university management should  
provide an action plan against weak areas identified in the survey results.
  2. By the individual faculties/departments which have mapped their PEOs (Program  
Educational Objectives) against different questions/categories in the survey  
questionnaire. Details about the PEOs for any program can be found on the webpage  
for that program/faculty. The KPIs for the attainment of the PEOs have been defined  
accordingly by that department/faculty. All this is part of the relatively recent ‘OBE =  
Outcome Based Education’ philosophy to which all engineering programs in Pakistan  
should adhere to if they want accreditation from PEC (Pakistan Engineering Council).  
The details about the KPI attainment for different PEOs is generally in the SAR  
(Self-Assessment Reports) document for the different programs, which are required  
to be created whenever a program applies for its re-accreditation from PEC.
