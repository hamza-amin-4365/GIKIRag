## DMSE Mission and Objective Based Education (OBE)
* * *
Technological advances dominate the world in which we live and well-qualified materials engineers are needed to cope with them. Their areas of concern are wide and varied. Whether it is production of a light but strong material for an aircraft wing or of a material for an artificial hip with all the properties of a bone, we need the expertise of a material engineer. He/she collaborates with engineers of other specializations to investigate problems such as the analysis of the structural failure of a bridge, the amount of wear of an engine component, or the corrosion of deep-sea oilrigs.
The engineer of tomorrow must be technically competent, market-conscious, commercially adept, environmentally sensitive and responsive to human needs. The curriculum of the department aims at producing such a multi-dimensional engineer. It provides a broad range of fundamental courses at the earlier stages and progressively leads the students to areas of their specializations. It includes the principles that govern the properties of metals, polymers, ceramics and composites, and the whole range of technologies which produce these materials and nanomaterials.
The Department offers 4 year BS program in Materials Engineering which deals with a broad understanding of materials and the manufacturing of components. It offers following streams:
  * Specialization in Manufacturing
  * Specialization in Nanotechnology


### Thrust Areas:
* * *
  * Materials Processing, Manufacturing and Characterization
  * Nanotechnology and Nano Materials
  * Ceramics, Polymers and Composites
  * Surface Engineering and Coating Technology

The memories of my admission into GIK Institute back in 1996 are always fresh in my mind. I was a young lad like you, looking into the details of what Materials Science and Engineering was all about, and decided to give it a shot considering the global scientific trends. Having been connected to the department and the field for 25 years, I must admit that the discipline around the globe has come a long way and my decision of becoming a Materials Engineer is proving to be the right choice every passing day. Technological advancements have made it essential to know, understand, research and improve the properties of materials along with producing break through inventions in the form of new materials, for instance, graphene, that have changed even the fundamentals of science. Thanks to advancements in Materials Science and Engineering, humanity has been able to manufacture devices at the nanoscale of which a smart watch is a perfect example. Modern flexible electronic devices employing stretchable screens and electronics, NASA’s space shuttles resisting extreme space environment, temperature sensor and body components of Mars Curiosity Rover, Beryllium mirror in James Webb Telescope to explore the universe, solar cells employing semiconductors, lithium-ion batteries employed in smartphones and electric vehicles, biomedical implants in the form of heart stents or dental braces are a few examples of how Materials Engineering has shaped the scientific community.
Our graduates have excelled as a result of the training they receive here and are currently involved as senior members in multinational FMCG organizations, founders of start-ups and, most-importantly, scientists in R&D organizations as well as professors in academic institutes worldwide. We inculcate in our graduates the qualities to adapt to whatever career they would like to pursue. So, come join us for our degree program and become of a part of the community shaping the world of today and tomorrow.
