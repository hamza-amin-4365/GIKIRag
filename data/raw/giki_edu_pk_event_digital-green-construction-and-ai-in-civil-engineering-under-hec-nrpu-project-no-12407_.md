**About:**  
The construction industry is responsible for 30% of global CO2 emission and concrete, the top consumed man-made material, is a major component of this industry. Further, construction is a time-consuming and costly process. To minimize these associated negative impacts, digital construction using geopolymer concrete is fast gaining attention in the modern world. How does digital construction/3-D concrete printing work? What is geopolymer concrete? Will it work in Pakistan? Letâ€™s try to find answers in this seminar.
