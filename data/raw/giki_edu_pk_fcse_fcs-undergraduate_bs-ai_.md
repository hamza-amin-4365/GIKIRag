## Bachelors of Science in Artificial Intelligence
The Artificial Intelligence program, partnered by Huawei, aims to give in-depth knowledge required to transform data (including Big Data) into intelligent decisions. The theme of the program and its curriculum is primarily based on inferring the machine-based decisions from the complex inputs, such as image, text, and databases. Upon completion of the coursework students will be able to select data driven technologies to mimic or enhance human capabilities. GIK Institute joins hands with Huawei (ranked 61st on Fortune Global 500 companies), to bring the cutting-edge technology along with the latest curriculum updates and equipment for the students in Artificial Intelligence program. Huawei Pakistan supports the program by providing student internships, certification opportunities in AI, faculty training and latest AI equipment for the students, which will enhance the skillset of the students and help secure better jobs in the market in future.
