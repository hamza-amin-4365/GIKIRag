**Ban on using plastic bags on campus**
GIK Institute promotes environmentally friendly practices by implementing a ban on the use of plastic bags at all grocery stores on campus due to their negative impact on the environment. This initiative encourages students, faculty, and staff to adopt more sustainable alternatives, with most residents bringing their eco-friendly tote bags for grocery shopping at the Tuc area on campus.
This initiative is aligned with SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, particularly under the parameter of improving resource efficiency in consumption and production. By reducing plastic waste and promoting reusable alternatives, the university is fostering a culture of sustainable consumption. This helps to conserve resources, reduce environmental harm, and promote more sustainable production practices on campus, while also encouraging students to adopt these behaviors in their daily lives. Such initiatives support the broader goals of sustainable economic growth by demonstrating that environmental responsibility can be integrated into everyday activities, contributing to a greener economy.
