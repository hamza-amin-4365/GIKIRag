## **Introduction**
The faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FCS&E) at GIK Institute has always strived for excellence in the field of computing and allied disciplines since its inception in 1993, and continues to pursue the latest trends in the computing industry. The graduates from FCSE have catered to the needs of the local software industry in Pakistan as well as for foreign industry – some alumni from earlier undergraduate batches are now in upper management posts in renowned software houses in Pakistan as well as abroad and continue to make the faculty and institute proud.
The field of Cyber Security (CyS) in recent times has played a crucial role in the field of business and security, and has become the lynchpin of automation processes. It is soon projected to become one of the most important factors in our daily lives. CyS has had widespread applications in all types of products – it is now central in each product we use, ranging from phones to manufacturing to flight safety to air conditioners and fridges to cars. In short, CyS is not only playing a significant role in changing our lives for good but is also shaping the economies of many countries. The honorable president of Pakistan, Dr. Arif-ur-Rehman Alvi, through his initiative (Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing – PIAIC) and Government of Pakistan, led by Mr. Imran Khan, have continuously urged and encouraged higher education institutes to take up emerging fields like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Cyber Security and Block Chain at undergraduate and diploma level. Thus, Cyber Security will hopefully play a vital role in the economy of Pakistan and is projected to become a multi-billion industry in the near future.
In-line with its tradition to actively pursue the cutting-edge trends and techniques as well as to proactively meet the future demands of industry, FCSE took the initiative to start the Bachelor of Science program in Cyber Security (B.S. in CS major CyS) and plans the first intake of students by Fall 2022. Under the guidance and supervision of the Rector GIK Institute, Dr. Fazal Ahmad Khalid, SI, Dean FCS&E and their team at FCS&E have been working hard to get all required pieces into place to meet the stringent deadlines for starting the program by Fall 2022. HEC NCEAC has finalized the curriculum for BS Cyber Security program at a recent curriculum meeting. We intend to follow the curriculum defined for BS program by NCEAC to define the structure and contents of BS in Cyber Security program offered by GIK Institute
##### **Major Trust Areas**
The major thrust areas of B.S. in Computer Science with specialization in Cyber Security program of GIK Institute are:
  * Digital Forensics
  * Network Security and Vulnerability Assessment
  * Emergency Preparedness and Response


## **Major features and unique selling points of B.S. in Cyber Security program**
The core focus of the program is to prepare undergraduate students for the latest cutting-edge technologies in the field of Computer Science such that they provide the work force required in the future for development of the country’s economy and become contributing members of the society. The curriculum is focused enough to produce graduates with excellent specialized knowledge of Cyber Security but broad enough for them to fit in with allied computing disciplines as well as learn the managerial and social aspects at undergraduate level for their future life as entrepreneurs and/or job hunters. Following are the unique selling points of BS in Cyber Security program offered by GIK Institute.
  * Incorporated critical thinking
  * Integrated learning approach through the common first year of all BS programs
  * Introduction of industrial labs guided and mentored by leading international industries
  * Mandatory internship to make graduates more relevant to the industry
  * Unique management electives and humanities courses especially tailored for Cyber Security graduates.
  * State-of-the-art technical courses incorporated into the degree plan on advice and approval from industry and subject experts.


The curriculum consists of 9 core computing courses, that provide breadth of computing to its graduates, e.g., _Software Engineering_ , _Databases_ , _Computer Networks and Communication_ , _Design and Analysis of Algorithms_ , and _Information Security_ , etc. At the same time, it assures that the study is focused on the field of Cyber Security and offers 6 core courses of Cyber Security that cover the basics necessary to excel in the field of Cyber Security. Since the foundations of Cyber Security are based on Statistics, the students are introduced to Statistics in first semester through _Introduction to Statistical Theory_ laying the foundation for Statistics heavy Cyber Security courses. Then, the students are introduced to the field of Cyber Security through the course _Introduction to Cyber Security_ in fourth semester. Other core Cyber Security courses, that the students take during their third and fourth year, include _Digital Forensics_ , _Information Assurance_ , _Network Security_ , _Secure Software Design and Development_ , and _Vulnerability Assessment & Reverse Engineering_. Hands on practical experience in specially designed labs under the supervision of qualified instructors in addition to the theoretical foundation built through courses is ensured for all core Cyber Security courses.
Since Cyber Security is a mathematical and modelling-heavy field as compared to other computing fields, the program offers more Mathematics and Statistics extensive foundation courses in Domain supporting, and Mathematics and Science foundation courses, e.g., _Calculus I_ , _Calculus II_ ,_Differential Equations and Linear Algebra_ , and _Introduction to Statistical Theory_.
Additionally, the program offers enough freedom to students to select four specialization electives of their choice from the field of Cyber Security or allied computing fields so that they can specialize within the thrust areas of their choice. Typical example here are _Malware Analysis_ , _Wireless and Mobile Security_ , _Penetration Testing_ , _Cryptanalysis_ , _Cyber Law & Cyber Crime (Cyber Warfare)_ etc.
Social Sciences and Humanity courses are, of course, included in the curriculum so that students are able to develop and polish communication and managerial skills as well as are groomed to contribute to the society, as is the hallmark of other GIK graduates. One of the program’s educational objectives is to devote Cyber Security to the well-being of society; students will also take courses in ethics and social responsibility.
For the curriculum, FCSE intends to get the approval of the department, the Board of Studies, the GIK Institutes’ Academic Council and the Governing Council. In addition, National Computing Education Accreditation (NCEAC) set up by Higher Education Commission (HEC) has also given the basic structure for development of new computing programs, and we have tried to follow the structure to get the program accredited by NCEAC.
For obtaining Bachelor of Science degree in Cyber Security, a student has to complete 134 credit hours with a CGPA of 2.0 or above. In addition, every BS (CS) student is required to participate in a summer training program and submit a formal written report during the summer of Junior Year. Moreover, every BS (CS) student will undertake a 15-hour community service activity as a degree requirement using the summers or fall semester of their Sophomore Year.
