Realizing the potential of open innovations in engineering, organizations and companies are engaging with an increasing number of external actors, including start-ups, SMEs, universities, and public/third sector organizations. These ecosystem actors represent a variety of capabilities and resources essential for innovation. However, complex interdependencies among external actors often present significant challenges for organizations’, including internal configurations and capturing value. Organizations gain significant competitive advantage through a proactive approach to actors and coalition development within the innovation ecosystem. Learnings from ecosystem actors on business and technology fronts influence internal organizational units in innovation and building new capabilities. In this webinar, Dr Ghani will talk about innovation ecosystems from a university perspective, particularly on capturing value.
