### Students’ evaluation of Teaching
GIK Institute conducts Students Evaluation of Teaching for all the courses offered in a  
semester. The students’ evaluation of teaching is conducted 1-2 weeks prior to the  
commencement of final exams in an online mode using the CMS software. The students are  
given 2 weeks to provide their feedback. The QEC office then prepares reports for the  
student evaluation for all the courses. Student identities are kept confidential and are never  
released in any of the reports. These reports are eventually sent to the individual course  
instructors, Deans/HoDs as well as the institute’s management for their review, and  
corresponding actions, if there is a need.
