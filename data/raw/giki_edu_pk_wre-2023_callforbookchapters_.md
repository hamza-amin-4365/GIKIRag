#### Publication
* * *
WRE 2023 seeks original book chapters on any topic listed above. Book chapters accepted after a double-blind review process will be published by the CRC Press (Taylor & Francis Group, USA) as a book series (Computer in Engineering Design and Manufacturing Series). The following terms and conditions must be fulfilled for acceptance of the book chapter.
**_Important Terms and Guidelines for Preparing the Book Chapters:_**
  * **A submitted chapter should not exceed 30 double spaced pages. There should be no more than 8 diagram in a chapter.** All diagrams must be black and white. When including figures/tables in your book, please ask yourself if they are essential and necessary to your book. Adding extra figures and tables that aren’t necessary can add to the production costs of the book so if you are using figures and tables for the purpose of simplifying the text, then keep them in. If you are using them to complement the text, or when the text already gives enough information, then no, the figures and tables are not considered essential or necessary to your book and should be removed. A good rule of thumb is if the results, information, or description of what the figure or table is showing can be clearly written in two sentences, then the figure or table is not essential or necessary to the book.
  * All chapters must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act by offering the readers contextual descriptions of all images included in a chapter. This is known as “**Alt Text** ”. This enhances comprehension and offers a better reading experience to those audiences that may need this type of assistance. Please see **Authors must include Alt Text for each image that appears in the submitted book chapter.**
  * **It is the responsibility of the author to go after, pay for, and secure permission to reuse any already published material that may be included in their book chapter.** Although we strongly encourage authors to use their own original unpublished material, we do understand at times, borrowed material might be needed. So to prevent any delays from the manuscript going into production, it is extremely important that you as the author take care of any permissions if needed. To help with any questions you might have regarding permissions, please see 
  * **All chapters should begin with a chapter abstract (about 150 words).** please see 
  * Contributors should not be focusing on writing their chapters related to any specific country.
  * Authors are encouraged to include case studies based inside as well as outside of the US, where possible.


#### No Registration or Publication Fee for Authors
* * *
The Financial Sponsor of WRE 2023 will cover all costs of the Workshop. No registration or publication fee will be charged to the authors of the accepted chapters. However, one of the authors of an accepted book chapters must register and present the work at WRE 2023 venue in order for their chapter to be included in the book series. Registration for authors and participants will be available through this website at a later stage.
#### Submission Guidelines

  * A manuscript should not exceed 30 double-spaced manuscript pages including all figures, tables, references and appendices.
  * All figures must be black and white. Use of color in text or tables is also not allowed.
  * The maximum allowed number of figures per manuscript is 8.
  * All chapters must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act by offering the readers contextual descriptions of all images included in a chapter. This is known as “**Alt Text** ”. This enhances comprehension and offers a better reading experience to those audiences that may need this type of assistance. Please see **Authors must include Alt Text for each image that appears in the submitted book chapter.**
  * All submission must include an abstract of up to 150 words.
  * All units should be provided in SI Units.
  * All submissions must be original and must not have been submitted simultaneously to another workshop, book series, conference or a journal.
  * We strongly encourage authors to use their own original unpublished material. However, we do understand that, at times, borrowed material might be needed. It is the responsibility of the authors to pay for/secure permission to reuse any already published material that may be included in their manuscript. **For help on how to obtain all necessary permissions for any copyrighted material you wish to reuse and for frequently asked questions, please**
