## Careers in Chemical Engineering
Quality of modern living standards has encouraged the mass production of various utilities, necessities and amenities. Since the birth of process & processing industry, after 18th century, there is a dramatic increase in its volume. Population trends and chain of never ending new/modern products ensures the growth in this sector. Furthermore struggling third world countries like Pakistan are now focusing to process their raw materials in their own facilities. When it comes to realization, chemical engineers become an essential part of the team to chart the layout and erection of the new production line. Existing plants also require chemical engineers not only supervising & ensuring their smooth operation but also for troubleshooting, demanding interaction between the engineers and scientists from various other fields. Resources at the faculty are designed to inculcate the necessary knowledge, practices and behavioral aspects in to the graduates, prerequisites for the responsibilities of professional life. Chemical engineers find their utility in various industries including chemical & petrochemical, nuclear, energy, oil & gas, food, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and in various defense sectors, in addition to emerging research fields. Furthermore, these engineers are equipped to collaborate with different resources at the plant including management, utility engineers and above all with the technicians and plant operators as they will be their observing eyes in the field.
