### Sustainability at GIK Institute
#### **Introduction**
The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.
Sustainable development is defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. They address the global challenges we face, including those related to poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice. The 17 Goals build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals and complete what these did not achieve. They seek to realize human rights for all and to achieve gender equality and women’s empowerment.
The SDGs are integrated—that is, they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others and that development must balance social, economic, and environmental sustainability. They also aim to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom. We have 17 goals to transform our world by 2030.
The SDGs work in the spirit of partnership and pragmatism to make the right choices now to improve life in a sustainable way for future generations. Its implementation will require cooperation from governments at all levels, business and industry, local communities’ civil society organizations (CSOs), other intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), and academia. All entities must contribute towards its realization.
In order to achieve these objectives, we must work together as a global community. At GIK Institute, we are committed to the SDGs because they reflect our vision for making the world a better place for everyone. We believe that it is our responsibility not only to meet the needs of present generations but also to ensure that future generations have the tools they need to meet their own needs.
