Engr. Dr. Fahad Muslim holds a PhD in Electronics Engineering from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Politecnico di Torino, Italy. Prior to joining GIKI, he was associated with the Systems-on-Chip lab at the Incheon National University, South Korea as a postdoctoral research fellow and as an assistant professor of Computing and Technology at Iqra University, Islamabad, Pakistan. He has also worked as a Research Assistant at the high-level synthesis research group headed by Prof. Luciano Lavagno at the Politecnido di Torino. Additionally, he also holds a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering with specialization in Wireless Communication Systems from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden.
Dr. Fahad holds an extensive research, teaching as well as administrative experience. He has worked at many prestigious national and international institutes (some ranked in top 100 universities according to QS ranking), including Politecnico di Torino, Incheon National University, Iqra University and Comsats University Islamabad (Abbottabad Campus).
Dr. Fahad’s main interests are in System-level design methodologies for embedded systems, High-level Synthesis, Machine Learning Accelerators and Energy-efficient heterogeneous architectures for high-performance computing systems. He has worked extensively on these topics and has published his work in well-reputed journals and conferences. He has published several ISI- and/or Scopus-indexed journal papers with a cumulative impact factor of more than 20 till date.
Dr. Fahad is currently teaching courses pertaining to computer organization and signal processing to the 2nd and 3rd year students of the faculty of Computer Science and Engineering at GIKI.
