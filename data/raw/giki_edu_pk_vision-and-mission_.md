### Mission
The Institute is to provide excellent teaching and research environment to produce graduates who distinguish themselves by their professional competence, research, entrepreneurship, humanistic outlook, ethical rectitude, pragmatic approach to problem solving, managerial skills and ability to respond to the challenge of socio-economic development to serve as the vanguard of techno-industrial transformation of the society.
### International Advisory Board
The founding fathers of the Institute were conscious of the fact that in spite of all the idealism one may have, new institutions tend to regress towards the existing models, and fail thereby to live up to the ideals which inspired their creation.
