## Introduction to Review of Institutional Performance and Enhancement (RIPE) Under HECâ€™s PSG-2023 Quality Assurance Framework
As part of its ongoing commitment to institutional excellence and continuous improvement, the GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology in 2025 has successfully initiated and conducted the Self-Review of Institutional Performance and Enhancement (RIPE) in accordance with the Quality Assurance Framework (PSG-2023) introduced by the Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan.
This comprehensive internal quality assurance process is overseen by the QEC Office and the Institutional Quality Circle (IQC), with the overarching goal of cultivating a culture of quality and accountability across all academic and administrative functions of the Institute.
### What is RIPE?
RIPE is a formal Institutional Self-Assessment (SA) process designed to evaluate the universityâ€™s overall performance for the previous academic year. It is conducted against the RIPE Standards specified in HECâ€™s PSG-2023 framework. The process considers inputs from:
  * Program-level self-assessments
  * Departmental and administrative evaluations
  * Feedback from students, faculty, and other stakeholders
  * Institutional arrangements with affiliated or partner institutions


RIPE ensures that all areas of institutional operations are continuously reviewed, enhanced, and aligned with national and global standards.
### Self-RIPE Process at GIKI
The RIPE process at GIKI is carried out in three main phases: Pre-Visit, On-Site Review, and Post-Visit Activities, with detailed coordination by the QEC Office and oversight by the IQC.
#### ðŸ”¹ Pre-Visit Activities
  * **IQC Initiation:** The Institutional Quality Circle initiates the RIPE cycle and constitutes two committees:
    * The Institutional Performance Report (IPR) Committee
    * The Follow-up Committee for previous recommendations
  * **Compilation of Reports:** These committees prepare the IPR and Follow-up Reports covering current progress, action items, and supporting evidence.
  * **Review by IQAE/QEC:** The IQAE/QEC Office verifies the reports for completeness, documentary support, and compliance with RIPE Standards.
  * **Formation of RIPE Committee/Review Panel:** A diverse RIPE Review Committee (5â€“7 members) is constituted, including at least one external expert and internal senior academics and administrators.
  * **Final Scheduling:** After report circulation, the RIPE visit is scheduled in consultation with the committee and Institute leadership.


#### ðŸ”¹ On-Site Review Activities
During the visit, the RIPE Committee:
  * Validates documentary evidence
  * Conducts detailed stakeholder meetings with:


  1. Students (Undergraduate to PhD)
  2. Faculty (junior and senior)
  3. Deans, HoDs, and administrative heads
  4. Directors of administrative departments


  * Visits physical facilities including classrooms, labs, libraries, hostels, cafeterias, and recreational spaces
  * Consolidates findings in a private meeting before concluding the visit


#### ðŸ”¹ Post-Visit Activities
  * **Report Preparation:** The RIPE Committee prepares a detailed report outlining findings, strengths, gaps, and recommendations.
  * **Submission and Moderation:** The report is submitted to QEC, signed by all members, and moderated for any conflicts.
  * **IQC Sign-Off:** The final report is reviewed and approved by the Institutional Quality Circle.
  * **Implementation & Monitoring:** QEC disseminates the report to relevant departments, and implementation progress is now being tracked as per QECâ€™s Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) process.


By conducting RIPE under PSG-2023, GIKI has taken a significant step toward aligning its internal systems with HECâ€™s vision for evidence-based governance, inclusive feedback mechanisms, and sustainable academic excellence.
This process reinforces our institutional commitment to:
  * Transparent governance
  * Stakeholder engagement
  * Quality enhancement across all domains
  * Preparing for external accreditations and global benchmarks
