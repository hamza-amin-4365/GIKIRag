# **Introduction**
The Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FCSE) at GIK Institute has always strived for excellence in the field of computing and allied disciplines since its inception in 1993, and continues to pursue the latest trends in the computing industry. The graduates from FCSE have catered to the needs of the local software industry in Pakistan as well as for foreign industry – some alumni from earlier undergraduate batches are now in upper management posts in renowned software houses in Pakistan as well as abroad and continue to make the faculty and institute proud. Many of our alumni from Computer Engineering (Computer Systems Engineering from 1993 – 2010) are or have remained part of renowned Top 100 Forbes companies like Microsoft Inc., Facebook and Google Inc. The student body has indeed been a source of pride for the faculty considering an annual intake of only 40 students every year and relatively recent beginnings of the faculty (since 1993, 26 batches have graduated so far).
The field of Computer Engineering (CE) has traditionally been a mix of two programs, major courses from Computer Sciences and minor courses from Electrical Engineering. It has played a crucial role in developing specialized Computer Scientists, who are well-aware of the underlying hardware and experts in solving domain problems related to both computer software and hardware. They excel in understanding the hardware-related issues that may affect the performance of a software deployed on the hardware. They are central to handling the many real-world complex problems through application of computing knowledge and hardware expertise to develop working prototypes that deploy both the software and the hardware components. Hence, Computer Engineering offers its students the unique ability to master both the core Computer Science topics, and the core Electrical Engineering items related to Computers. In that regard, just like Mechatronics does for Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering programme is a true merger of the field of Computer Science and a few topics from Electrical Engineering. In recent times, particularly with the introduction of Objective-Based Education (OBE) and the accrediting body of all engineering programmes, Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC), becoming a signatory to the Washington Accord, the degree of Computer Engineering is one of the most sought off degree in Pakistan and in international market.
In-line with its tradition to actively pursue the cutting-edge trends and techniques as well as to proactively meet the future demands of industry, FCSE took the initiative to start the Bachelor of Science program in Computer Systems Engineering (B.S. in CSE) in 1993 with the first intake of students. FCS&E then subsequently introduced the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Software Engineering in 2003. In line with the recent trends in industry and demand from PEC, the Bachelor of Science in Computer Systems Engineering was renamed to Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (B.S. in CE) from 2011 onwards along with various updates to the curriculum and since then, the curriculum has been regularly updated through semester-wise meetings of various faculty, curriculum advisory board and Academic Council meetings. Under the guidance and supervision of the Rector GIK Institute, Engr. Jahangir Bashar, Dean FCSE and their team at FCSE have been working hard to get all required pieces into place to keep the program curriculum in line with PEC as well as keeping the standard of the program as high as possible. The employment ratio after graduation, the popularity of the program among admission candidates at GIK Institute, and the successful contribution of the alumni from Computer Engineering program are a proof that the program has been a huge success for GIK Institute, by the grace of Allah Almighty and the continuous hardwork of the faculty, students and all involved stakeholders of the program.
# _Major Thrust Areas_
The major thrust areas of B.S. in CE program of GIK Institute are:
  1. Signal and Image Processing,
  2. Digital System Design,
  3. Microprocessor Interfacing,
  4. Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems, and
  5. Computer Networks.


## _Major and Salient features of B.S. in CE curriculum_
The core focus of the program is to prepare undergraduate students for the latest cutting-edge technologies in the field of Computer Engineering such that they provide the work force required in the future for development of the country’s economy and become contributing members of the society. The curriculum is focused enough to produce graduates with excellent specialized knowledge of Computer Engineering but broad enough for them to fit in with allied computing and engineering disciplines as well as learn the managerial and social aspects at undergraduate level for their future life as entrepreneurs and/or job hunters.
The program curriculum is fully compliant with the requirements for the PEC approved Computer Engineering curriculum. It consists of 41 courses, spread across eight semesters, with minimum of 16 credit hours and a maximum of 18 credit hours in a semester. Sixteen credit hours have been allocated to the practical labs with courses, in addition to the 6 credit hours of lab work associated with the Final Year Projects. The degree is well-balanced, with at most three labs in a semester and a maximum of fifteen credit hours allocated to theory in a semester. The curriculum retains the traditional flair of a typical Computer Science degree in addition to the rigor required for an Electrical Engineering program. The courses are well-distributed across semesters and categories such that the program has the right mix of Humanities and Mathematics courses. There is one Humanities course in every semester and there is one course of Mathematics in the first five semesters. Such a spread enables students to grasp the right foundation in the right dose. It helps them develop Management skills as well as the basic Mathematical skills necessary for a Computer Engineering program without too much pressure.
The curriculum consists of 07 core courses laying the right foundation for an Engineering program. The courses in this category are _Fundamentals of Logic Design_ , _Circuit Analysis_ , _Electronics I_ , _Object-Oriented Programming_ , _Data Structures and Algorithms_ , _Signals and Systems_ , and _Computer Organization and Assembly Language_. In addition, a lab on _Computer Engineering Workshop_ has also been added to give the students a taste of computer hardware right in the first semester.
Since this is a computing program, 03 core Computing courses that provide the basics of computing to its graduates have been added to the program, i.e., _Fundamentals of Computer Science_ , _Computer Programming_ , and _Discrete Structures_. Moreover, 08 major Computer Engineering courses are added into the curriculum that cover the basics necessary to excel in the field of Computer Engineering. This list includes _Operating Systems_ , _Introduction to Databases_ , and _Software Architecture and Engineering_ , _Computer Communications and Networks_ , _Microprocessor Interfacing_ , _Signal Processing_ , _Digital System Design_ , and _Cloud and Distributed Computing_ courses. Hands on practical experience in specially designed labs under the supervision of qualified instructors in addition to the theoretical foundation built through courses is ensured for all core Computer Engineering courses.
Furthermore, CE is a typical mathematical and modelling-heavy engineering, and the program offers a god foundation in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, i.e., _Calculus I_ , _Calculus II_ ,_Differential Equations and Linear Algebra_ , _Probabilistic and Statistical Methods in Engineering_ , and _Complex Variables and Transforms_. The program also offers the course _Essentials of Electricity and Magnetism_ in this category.
Additionally, the program offers enough freedom to students to select four specialization electives of their choice from the field of AI or allied computing fields so that they can specialize within the thrust areas of their choice. Typical example here are _Robotics_ , _Image Processing_ , _Advanced Databases_ , _Artificial Intelligence_ , _Bioinformatics_ , _Data Science_ , etc.
Social Sciences and Humanity courses are, of course, included in the curriculum so that students are able to develop and polish communication and managerial skills as well as are groomed to contribute to the society, as is the hallmark of other GIK graduates. One of the program’s educational objectives is to devote AI to the well-being of society; students will also take courses in ethics and social responsibility.
For the curriculum, FCSE has already received the approval of the department for the updated curriculum, and intends to get the approval of the Board of Studies, and the GIK Institutes’ Academic Council.
