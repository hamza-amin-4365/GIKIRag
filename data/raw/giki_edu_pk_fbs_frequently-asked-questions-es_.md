### Frequently Asked Questions
#### FAQ-1: What is Engineering Sciences at GIK Institute?
Engineering Sciences (ES) is a PEC-accredited Multidisciplinary Engineering Program that offers you the opportunity to prepare yourself for some of the most modern fields of engineering including Data Analytics, Smart Devices, Modern Instrumentation, and Communication Technologies.
First two years of the program are very similar to common engineering programs, while from the third year, students can choose courses according to their target career.
In short, ES is a multidisciplinary engineering program with a flexible career path suited for those who think outside the box and want to gauge their interests before committing to a particular direction.
Infographic below gives a quick overview of the curriculum, specialization options, and resulting career paths.

#### FAQ-2: What Distinguishes the Engineering Sciences Program from other Engineering Programs?
The key distinguishing feature of the ES program is that it allows students to choose their direction after two years. By joining the ES program, you get the opportunity to learn basic sciences, engineering, and computing common to most modern engineering programs in the first two years. Then, having carefully gauged your aptitude and interests, you can choose either to go for the hardware (sensors, systems) of modern tech, or its brain (algorithms, AI).
**_So, for example, if you are interested in the hardware and sensors of Smart Cars or Drones you can choose Photonics and Microelectronics, while if you are interested in writing the artificial intelligence-based algorithms for Smart Cars and Drones you may choose Simulation and Machine Learning. The good thing is that you do not have to make this choice in the first year and can see how your interest develops in the first two years before you choose._**
#### FAQ-3: Is Engineering Sciences Only Suitable for those Interested in Higher Studies?
No. While a good proportion of GIKI graduates goes for higher studies, most of the graduates are currently working in industry. This is true for Engineering Sciences as well.
#### FAQ-4: Which Local and International Companies Hire ES Graduates?
ES graduates are typically able to avail career opportunities in
  * Communications (Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei etc.)
  * Instrumentation & Control (Engro, Fatima, Dawlance etc),
  * Renewable Energy (ReOn, Pantera, SkyElectric etc.)
  * AI, Software Solutions, and Data Analytics (Afiniti, Systems, Tkxel, Motiv etc.).
  * Microelectronics, Embedded, and Smart Systems (Microsoft, AMD etc.)
  * Engineering Management & Leadership (Unilever, P&G, GSK, Reckitt etc.)
  * Higher Education in International Universities (MS and PhD)
  * Engineering, Research, and Leadership Positions in a large range of organizations abroad

#### FAQ-7: Why is there a Separate Program of Engineering Sciences instead of it being a part of Electrical or Computer Engineering?
The concept of Engineering Sciences is built around allowing flexibility in curriculum design and updating according to newly emerging fields of engineering. Such new fields typically do not fit within strict conventional boundaries and can be well covered under the umbrella of Engineering Sciences as interdisciplinary engineering. A similar model is available in many Western universities.
A key distinguishing feature of the ES program is that it **_allows students to choose their direction after two years_**. By joining the ES program you get the opportunity to learn basic sciences, engineering, and computing common to most modern engineering programs in the first two years. Then, having carefully gauged your aptitude and interests, you can choose either to go for the hardware (sensors, systems) of modern tech, or its brain (algorithms, AI).
