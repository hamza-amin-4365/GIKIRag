3rd International Conference on Modern Technologies in Mechanical & Materials Engineering **(MTME-2025)**
**_Conference Overview_**
The 3rd International Conference on Modern Technologies in Mechanical and Materials Engineering ** _(MTME-2025)_** will be held on **April 16-17, 2025** , at GIK Institute, Topi, Pakistan.
The objective of MTME-2025 is to bring innovative academics and industrial experts together in the field of Mechanical and Materials Engineering to a common forum. The primary goal of the conference is to promote research and development activities in four core research areas (design and manufacturing, thermo-fluids, drives and control, and materials sciences), and to promote exchange of scientific knowledge between researchers, developers, engineers, students, and practitioners working all around the world.
