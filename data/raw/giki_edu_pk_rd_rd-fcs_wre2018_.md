Addressing the congregations, Professor Dr. Jameel-Un Nabi, Pro-Rector (Academic), GIK Institute, said that Pakistan relies on the import of CNC machinery, which results in prohibitive cost. Therefore, reverse engineering and enterprises of reverse engineering gain more importance. He added that the objectives of the workshop are to develop indigenous expertise in functional reverse engineering and to foster an implementable model for enterprise of reverse engineering at GIK for promoting enterprises of reverse engineering in KP.
The Special Advisor to CM on Science and Technology, Mr. Kamran Khan Bangash, proposed that such gatherings for youths of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa especially, and the county in general, should be held frequently.
Both the Chief Guests and Professor Dr. Jameel-Un Nabi congratulated the untiring efforts of the Workshop General Chair, Professor Dr. Wasim A.
