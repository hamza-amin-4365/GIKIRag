###### **Project Summary**
The need for cost-effective solar energy grows increasingly urgent as the demand for and price of power continues to rise and the global warming caused by fossil fuel combustion escalates. Solar energy is an unlimited form of clean and renewable energy that is abundantly available in Pakistan. Cost effective harvesting of solar energy can endlessly fuel our civilization. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been identified as next generation solar cell technology due to their simple fabrication process, potential low cost, and ability to be deposited on large-area flexible substrates. Although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs has steadily increased, further increases in efficiency and low-cost fabrication are still required for applications. The potential for improvement of various DSSC components is enormous and is the focus of this joint project.
Many countries have invested heavily in DSSC research and development. Building expertise in this multidisciplinary area will help them establish industries for cost effective large scale photovoltaic production. Pakistan’s current capabilities and resources in DSSC-related research and technology are very limited. If Pakistan is to meet its energy needs and become a globally competitive entity in this growth industry, it must establish the scientific and technical expertise and infrastructure necessary to conduct research in the development of next generation DSSC technologies and provide consultancy to local industry.
The goals of this project are to develop next generation dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with lower cost, longer stability, and higher efficiency, and to provide research training in both countries to students and postdoctoral scientists in the field of solar energy. Both Pakistan and the U.S. import a lot of oil. The successful development of high efficiency reliable DSSCs may reduce and ultimately eliminate dependence on foreign oil for both Pakistan and the US. If successful, this project will open new sciences and advance the field of DSSCs.
The collaborative team from the Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute (GIKI) of Engineering Sciences and South Dakota State University (SDSU) in the US, in collaboration with their other academic and industrial partners, will address fundamental challenges in DSSCs by integrating their complementary expertise in the following areas: dye molecule calculation and synthesis, solid state hole transporter development, carbon nanostructures as counter electrodes, DSSC device physics, and device fabrication. The research objectives will include: (1) design, calculate, synthesize and characterize broad spectrum absorbing dyes, (2) develop novel carbon nanofibers as an inexpensive alternative to Pt counter electrodes, (3) use solid-state hole transport materials to replace liquid electrolytes, (4) fabricate, optimize and test DSSCs, and (5) transfer new DSSC technology to industrial partners for commercialization. The resulting breakthroughs will address the challenges of efficiency, stability and cost.
This research will significantly advance understanding of current DSSCs through a transformative approach to broaden the light absorption spectrum, improve hole transport via solid state materials, and lower counter electrode cost. The design, optimization, and characterization of DSSC materials and devices are critical to improving their performance. The proposed new dyes, solid state hole transporters, and new counter electrode nanostructures are beyond state-of-the-art and represent the cutting edge of the DSSC field.
This collaborative project will serve as a platform for producing scientists and engineers trained in the design and fabrication of cost effective DSSC devices and modules. Upon the successful completion of this project, the program will be elevated to a self-sustaining center of DSSC research at the GIKI that will liaise with industry in developing low cost stand-alone solar cell modules and related products of commercial importance.
###### **Project Background**
Energy plays a critical role in economic development throughout the world. Pakistan is a developing country that has suffered severe energy deficiency over the last few years. Unfortunately, this energy deficiency continues to amplify, adversely affecting commercial and economic activities, as well as quality of life. For example, summer heat is a reported cause of many a sleepless night in Pakistan [1].
Solar energy has the potential to meet Pakistan’s energy needs. In the near future, it may be possible to use low cost processing to develop dye-senstized solar cells, making stand-alone solar modules available and affordable for everyone. The amount of solar energy that reaches the earth every year is 3×1024 J, or ~ 10,000 times more than current global use. Covering 0.16% of the earth’s surface with solar cells at an efficiency of 10% would meet the current energy needs of the entire world [2, 3]. However, the electricity generated from solar cells today is less than 0.1% of the world’s total energy demand [3-5].
Located in the Sun Belt, Pakistan is an ideal place to harvest solar energy. With 10% efficient solar cells, the sunlight that illumines 0.50% of Balochistan province would be sufficient to meet the energy needs of the entire country.[6] Despite such potential, little research has been done on solar cells in Pakistan to date. There are almost no active research professors or groups working on solar cells, especially DSSCs.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have shown great potential as a cost effective alternative to silicon solar cells due to their low cost of materials and fabrication. Although laboratory DSSCs have reached an efficiency of 12% [7] since their invention by Gratzel two decades ago [8, 9], DSSCs are still hampered by inefficiency, instability, and high cost. Current efficiency still falls short of the industry sought minimum threshold of 15% [10]. Successful development of efficient, stable, low cost DSSCs will enable reductions in fossil fuel use, greenhouse gas emissions, and global warming. 
This collaborative research project unites a U.S. researcher, who has a strong background in the fabrication and characterization of DSSCs and is equipped with all the required facilities, with a Pakistani team (led by Prof. Sayyad) with vast research experience in the fabrication and characterization of organic electronic materials and devices. Such collaboration will enable the development of the next generation of DSSCs in Pakistan. The project objectives will be to (i) develop the necessary fabrication and characterization facilities at the GIKI, (ii) train students and faculty in next generation organic solar cell technology, (iii) provide consultancy and expertise to industry, and (iv) facilitate Pakistan’s efforts to address its critical energy needs in a sustainable manner.
In order to train the Pakistani researchers in the area of DSSCs, the U.S. partner, Dr. Qiao, will teach several short courses at GIKI. Several undergraduate and graduate students in both countries will be involved in the research and will visit the partnering universities. As the participants work together on this three-year project of mutual interest, they will build personal and professional ties with one another.

4. Literature survey was done and will be done throughout the project execution.  
5. Hosted the visit of US PI Dr. Qiao at GIKI from December 12-15, 2013.  
6. Jointly with the US PI, organized the “2013 GIKI-SDSU International Symposium on the Design of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells for Cost Effective Solar Energy Harvesting” at the Faculty of Engineering Sciences, GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, Topi, Pakistan, on the 13th-15th of December, 2013. About 150 scholars, including 07 invited speakers, about 110 students, 30 faculty members from all over Pakistan and 3 foreigners participated in the symposium (Photo gallery symposium). For tentative schedule, participant roster, or any other relevant documentation, please see the attachment “2013 GIKI-SDSU International Symposium”.  
7. Two seminars were given by the PI at the “2013 GIKI-SDSU International Symposium on the Design of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells for Cost Effective Solar Energy Harvesting”.  
8. The equipment, consumables and software needed for the project execution has been identified and tendered with the consultation of the US PI and Pakistani academic and industrial collaborators.  
9. Collaborators having experience in the synthesis of dye families have been identified and requested to appoint students to synthesize the dyes.
**US side:**
10. The US PI Dr Qiquan Qiao visited Pakistan partner Prof Hassan Sayyad at GIKI December 12-15, 2013.  
11. As discussed above, the US PI, working together with the Pakistan PI, organized the “2013 GIKI-SDSU International Symposium on the Design of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells for Cost Effective Solar Energy Harvesting” at the Faculty of Engineering Sciences, GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, Topi, Pakistan, on the 13th-15th of December, 2013.  
12. Incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles into SnO2nanofibers as photoanode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) improved the cell efficiency from 4.63% to 6.17%. The addition of TiO2 nanoparticles increased the surface area of the photoanode that led to the enhancement in the dye attachment. In addition, the incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles helped in the reduction of the recombination of electrons in the photoanode with the electrolyte resulting in the increase in the open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF).  
13. Electrospun carbon nanofiber (ECN)/TiO2 nanoparticle composite counter electrode (CE) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were successfully prepared by spray-coating ECNs/TiO2 (1:1 by weight) mixture on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)-glass substrate. TiO2 particles (Degussa P25) were used to bind carbon nanofibers and adhere them to the FTO-glass substrate. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements revealed that the spray-coated ECN/TiO2 composite CEs have lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) and higher interfacial capacitance (Q) than those of Pt CEs. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) further indicated that ECNs/TiO2 composite CEs have faster tri-iodide reduction rate than those of Pt CEs. DSSCs fabricated using ECNs/TiO2 CEs showed a power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.25% under 100 mW/cm2 light intensity, which is comparable to that of thermally deposited Pt based DSSCs (η=7.57%). Moreover, ECNs/TiO2 composite CE based DSSCs demonstrated almost equal power conversion efficiency to that of Pt based cells by adding only 8 w.t% Pt, which unveiled a cost-effective alternative of costly Pt CEs in DSSCs.
