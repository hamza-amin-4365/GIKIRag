## **_Conference Overview_**
The 1st International Conference on Modern Technologies in Mechanical and material Engineering ** _(MTME-2023)_** will be held on May 06, 2023, at GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, Topi, Pakistan. The objective of MTME-2023 is to bring innovative academics and industrial experts together in the field of Mechanical and Material Engineering to a common forum. The primary goal of the conference is to promote research and developmental activities in four core research areas (design and manufacturing, thermo-fluids, Drives and Controls and materials), and to promote exchange of scientific knowledge between researchers, developers, engineers, students, and practitioners working all around the world. The conference will provide a platform for people to share views and experiences in Mechanical and Material Engineering.
