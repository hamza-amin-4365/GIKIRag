The Thermo-Fluids Research Group at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, GIK Institute is committed to driving forward research and innovation within the dynamic realm of thermal and fluid sciences. Our focus lies squarely on applications critical to modern engineering, where we delve into a diverse array of topics. From optimizing the use of biofuels in internal combustion engines to unraveling the complexities of experimental fluid mechanics, and from exploring natural fluids refrigeration to designing micro hydro turbines, microfluidic systems, and microchannel heat sinks, our pursuits span the breadth of this multifaceted field.
At the forefront of sustainable energy solutions, our efforts extend to pioneering solar thermal energy applications, advancing hydrogen fuel cell technology, and innovating phase change materials for heat sink optimization. Moreover, we are actively engaged in the refinement of vacuum distillation techniques and the exploration of the potential of adsorption refrigeration. Through a blend of meticulous experimentation and rigorous theoretical analysis, we are steadfast in our mission to confront pressing challenges and propel the boundaries of knowledge within thermo-fluid dynamics.
We invite you to join us on this journey as we forge pathways toward a greener, more efficient future through collaborative exploration and groundbreaking discovery.
