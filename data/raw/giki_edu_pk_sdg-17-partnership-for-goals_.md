**Prof. Dr. Fazal Khalid, Rector GIKI participated in the Pre-Conference at AIOU Roundtable AI and Academic Integrity: Navigating Ethical Issues in Education**
Prof. Dr. Fazal Khalid, Rector of Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute (GIKI), participated in the Pre-Conference at Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) on the roundtable discussion “AI and Academic Integrity: Navigating Ethical Issues in Education.” This event focused on the ethical challenges that artificial intelligence (AI) presents in the context of education, particularly in maintaining academic integrity, fairness, and transparency in the use of AI tools for learning and assessment. Prof. Dr. Khalid’s participation in this discussion aligns with **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 17** , which emphasizes “Partnerships for the Goals.” SDG 17 highlights the importance of strengthening partnerships and fostering collaboration among institutions, governments, and other stakeholders to address global challenges, including those related to technology in education. By engaging in dialogues on the ethical use of AI, Prof. Dr. Khalid’s involvement supports the idea that collaboration between universities, policymakers, and the tech industry is crucial to ensuring that AI is used responsibly in educational settings. This, in turn, can help create a more equitable and ethical educational environment that benefits all learners, ensuring that AI technologies enhance rather than undermine academic integrity and promote shared knowledge.
