“Scope and Objective of the course:  
Chemical Engineers are required to know principles of physical and analytical chemistry for thorough understanding of the discipline of chemical engineering. For this purpose, this course is designed to facilitate chemical engineers.  
Physical chemistry plays a very important role in the chemical engineering field. This branch of Chemistry provides the basis for understanding kinetics, thermodynamics and catalysis.  
Similarly, analytical chemistry is very useful the qualitative and quantitative study of chemical systems. Engineer, Scientists and technologists need not only to establish the identity of materials but also to quantify their composition and purity and to measure contamination at PPB level. Even the most abstruse academic researcher needs to be able to analyze his starting materials or products and frequently to measure minute changes in chemical composition in order to be able to draw meaningful conclusions. It is very important for a chemical engineer to have knowledge and understanding of both physical and analytical chemistry.
