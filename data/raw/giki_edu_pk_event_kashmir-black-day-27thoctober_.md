Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) and Kashmiris in all over the world observed Black Day on Wednesday (October 27, 2021) to mark the illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir by India on October 27, 1947. It was on this day when the Indian troops invaded Jammu and Kashmir and occupied it in a blatant violation of the Partition Plan of the subcontinent and against the Kashmiris’ aspirations.
