**GIK Institute** suggests a range of involvement opportunities for our alumni and current students as volunteer. Volunteering provides you the opportunity to give something back to your Institute, while having fun and developing new skills and alliances. Volunteers can become a valuable resource and do a lot to enhance the programs and activities of the GIK Institute Alumni Relations. These are some of the volunteer opportunities available:
**Alumni Chapters and Networks**  
You can easily stay in touch with your fellow graduates and the GIK community by getting involved with our office and **GIK Institute Alumni Association â€“ GIKAA.**
Chapters may offer opportunities for social and professional networking with alumni from your faculty/discipline area, or who live in the same region, or work in the same industry.  
Networks and Chapters may be organized as:
  * Regional groups (country, city, or region)
  * Educational areas (faculty or discipline area)
  * Professional or industry areas


These Chapters may function in association with our office and **GIKIAA** to organize events and projects that benefit alumni and our current students.

**Student Career Support Program**  
**Student Career Support Program** is a program planned to be held each year to provide an opportunity to engage both current students and alumni together. The program is designed to provide particularly senior year students with the opportunity to improve their career related skills such as job seeking techniques, CV /cover letter writing, mock interviews etc. The mock interview session will give students the opportunity to be interviewed by winning GIK alumni and be given productive face to face feedback and advices.  
Alumni are vital to the success of the program as they are supposed to perform as interviewers. Imagine how pleasing it will be for our current students to genuinely help them practice their interview skills and prepare for their future career. Our alumni involvement will guarantee students enter the rigorous interviews ahead of them with the assurance to succeed.
