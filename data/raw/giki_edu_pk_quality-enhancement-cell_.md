### Introduction
Universities in Pakistan play a crucial role in the nation’s overall advancement. Their importance extends beyond merely awarding degrees; they are instrumental in developing high-quality human resources for various sectors of the economy. To support this objective, the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) has established guidelines to evaluate educational quality in Pakistan, ensuring it remains accessible and aligned with global needs and evolving conditions. GIKI, as the first privately funded institution of its kind in Pakistan, is committed to elevating Engineering Education to the standards of advanced countries. The engineering programs at GIKI are accredited by the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) and adhere to internal quality benchmarks to improve teaching and learning. The institution is dedicated to enhancing its monitoring standards to align with competitive international education and research standards. The establishment of the Quality Enhancement Cell at GIKI, following the guidelines of Pakistan’s Higher Education Commission (HEC), represents a further commitment to maintaining and improving educational quality.
### Function/Activities
The Quality Enhancement Cell (QEC) was established on 20 February 2008 at Rectors Secretariat in the H.U. Beg Administration Building of the Institute. The Quality Enhancement Cell (QEC) as outlined by the Higher Education Commission (HEC) guidelines, is integral to advancing and maintaining educational quality. Its primary function is to develop, implement, and monitor quality assurance policies that align with national and international standards. The QEC is responsible for conducting internal evaluations of academic programs and faculty performance to ensure compliance with accreditation requirements and institutional goals. It systematically reviews curricula and teaching methodologies to reflect current industry standards and educational trends. Additionally, the QEC gathers and analyzes feedback from students, faculty, and other stakeholders to identify areas for improvement and implement action plans accordingly. It plays a crucial role in facilitating external audits, and ensuring continuous alignment with HEC directives. The QEC also promotes faculty development through training workshops and fosters communication between all stakeholders to support quality enhancement initiatives across the institution.
The Annual Activity Calendar of QEC Activities at GIK Institute is available 
The Quality Enhancement Cell (QEC) at GIK Institute has formally adopted the revised Quality Assurance (QA) Framework – PSG-2023, introduced by the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) of the Higher Education Commission (HEC). This updated framework reflects a more robust, outcomes-based approach to quality assurance across all academic and institutional processes.
In line with the PSG-2023 guidelines, the Institutional Quality Circle (IQC) has been duly constituted at GIK Institute. The IQC serves as a strategic body that oversees the internal quality assurance processes, supports academic and administrative units, and ensures compliance with national QA standards. The Notification of IQC is available 
All program assessments, self-review exercises, and quality policies are now being conducted in accordance with the PSG-2023 framework. This marks a significant step forward in GIK Institute’s commitment to academic excellence, transparency, and continuous improvement, while strengthening alignment with both national and international best practices in higher education quality assurance.
Draft Revamped QA Framework (PSG-2023) Documents are available for download on
