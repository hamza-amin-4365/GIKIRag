**Abstract:**  

Engineering contributes significantly to the economic well-being, social stability, and cultural development of society. Engineering also plays an important role in global human development, sustainability, and preservation of the environment. The importance of high-quality engineering education is therefore self-evident. Based on the speaker’s experience as a professional engineer and university educator, this paper highlights the recent challenges, opportunities, and future trends in engineering education. Major challenges currently facing engineering education are related to curriculum, teaching and learning, and the educational environment. As to quality, the balance needs to be maintained between general excellence and targeted areas of excellence. In terms of pedagogy, the focus should be on the improvement of students’ problem-solving and learning skills, the ability for continued learning throughout their careers, and soft skills (leadership qualities, teamwork, communication skills, and an understanding of economics, business, management, and innovation and entrepreneurship). Good support should be available in terms of qualified technical personnel and well-equipped workshops, laboratories, and computing facilities. Some of the emerging trends in engineering education include hands-on learning labs, industry-centric curriculum, upgradation of classroom environment and facilities (to support active learning and group-based learning), and use of interactive learning technologies (such as adaptive learning software, e-learning, distance learning, etc.).
