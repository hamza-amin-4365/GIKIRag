# Graduate Program:
The dynamics of the research and process industry require professionals who can upgrade the present  
manufacturing processes, develop, and design alternative technologies. The graduate program in the  
chemical engineering department is specially designed to provide excellent opportunities to the students who will be seeking higher studies or carrying on their careers as professional engineers. The graduate program in chemical engineering consists of two degrees the Masters (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree programs.
The strength of the graduate program in Chemical Engineering has the diversity that covers all major aspects of chemical engineering like designing, process dynamics & synthesizing energy sector, and materials production. The program is designed to provide indepth knowledge of Chemical Engineering to enhance the analytical skills and research capabilities of the graduates. It is a unique opportunity to learn the latest and advanced technologies to resolve interdisciplinary complex engineering problems.
Graduates of the Chemical Engineering at GIK institute are expected to be able to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for a promising professional to identify, formulate, innovative design, and solve bottlenecks utilizing critical-thinking and problem-solving abilities.
## **DChE Mission**
The mission of the department of chemical engineering is to develop and disseminate the understanding of designing and operations of chemical processes so that our graduates can excel in academia, research, business, and industry to contribute ethically for the humanistic development of the society.
## **Thrust Areas**
The graduate program in Chemical Engineering consists of lectures and hands-on research training emphasizing underlying principles and their engineering applications. A number of core and elective courses are offered as per the graduate approved degree plan leading them to earn a Masters (MS) or Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in their respective fields of specialization.
The Graduate Programs can be pursued in one of the following research areas but not limited to these as student can opt the research area as per his/her interest and supervisor advice:
  1. ### Process & Equipment Design
  2. ### Fluid handling and Thermodynamic Behavior
  3. ### Catalytic Reaction
  4. ### Transport Processes Engineering
  5. ### Modeling and Simulation
  6. ### Waste Water Treatment


### Degree Requirement
## MS Course Work
To attain the MS degree in chemical engineering a graduate student has to complete 30 credit hours (8 courses generally 3 CHs each plus 6 CHs thesis). The coursework is distributed in three groups, the requisite research courses, the core, and the elective courses. The requisite research courses are mandatory with zero credit hours. From the core courses, a student has to take a minimum of 4 courses, while the remaining 4 courses can be selected based on the field of specialization on a selected research topic for MS thesis.
## Ph.D. Course Work
To attain the PhD degree in chemical engineering a graduate student has to complete 36 credit hours (8 courses generally 3 CHs each plus 12 CHs thesis). Out of eight courses, at least four must be from the list of Graduate Chemical Engineering courses and the remainder from the other faculties of the institute.
