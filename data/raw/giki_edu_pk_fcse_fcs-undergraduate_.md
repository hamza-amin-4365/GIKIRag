## Bachelors Degree Overview
FCSE employs competent faculty members qualified to accomplish the mission and goals of the Institute. When determining acceptable qualifications of its faculty, FCSE asserts primary consideration to the terminal degree in the discipline. FCSE also considers competence, effectiveness and capacity, including, as appropriate, undergraduate and graduate degrees, related work experiences in the field, professional licensure and certifications, honors and awards, continuous documented excellence in teaching, or other demonstrated competencies and achievements that contribute to effective teaching, research and student learning outcomes.
The undergraduate programs combine the strength of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. The courses develop a professional approach to design computer-based systems, looking at both widely applicable principles of software engineering and the evolving computing technologies in the thrust areas of the faculty. Students are admitted to a four-year BS degree in the Faculty of Computer Science & Engineering, opting for one of the following three specialized degree programs:
[Bachelors of Science in Cyber Security](https://giki.edu.pk/fcse/fcs-undergraduate/bachelors-of-science-in-cyber-security/)
