**President WWF International, Prof. Dr. Adil Najam delivered a thought-provoking lecture at GIK on “Pakistan and Climate Change in the Age of Adaptation.”**
President of WWF International, Prof. Dr. Adil Najam, delivered a thought-provoking lecture at Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute (GIK) on “Pakistan and Climate Change in the Age of Adaptation,” highlighting the critical challenges posed by climate change, particularly for countries like Pakistan, which face severe risks to their ecosystems and biodiversity. His lecture emphasized the importance of adapting to climate change impacts, such as rising temperatures, flooding, and desertification, all of which threaten terrestrial ecosystems and land productivity. This directly links to **Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15)** , which focuses on protecting, restoring, and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. Prof. Najam stressed the need for robust conservation strategies, sustainable land management, and ecosystem restoration to safeguard the natural habitats and biodiversity that are increasingly threatened by climate change. He encouraged multi-sectoral efforts to manage land degradation, protect forests, and restore damaged ecosystems, all of which are essential to achieving SDG 15. By addressing these interconnected environmental issues, Prof. Najam’s insights highlighted how effective adaptation to climate change can also contribute to the broader goal of preserving life on land.
