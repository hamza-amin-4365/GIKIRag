Research Interests: Cyber Security, Encryption Protocols, Digital Multimedia Systems, Video Compression and Communication, Video Transcoding, Content Adaptation, Pervasive Media delivery
###### Introduction
* * *
Dr. Rashad Jillani holds PhD degree in Computer Engineering from the 
His PhD dissertation is on scalable extension (SVC) of H.264/AVC (Advanced Video Coding) to reduce complexity by improvising motion estimation algorithms using machine learning techniques. During his PhD, he worked with 
His industrial and professional experience includes cyber security and building Application Security Platform that provides strong security throughout any enterprise and its connected partners. This service provides authentication/authorization modules based on digital certificates and role based access model.
###### Research Overview
* * *
Our research interests are in the areas of visual information processing that considers the entire video pipeline — capture, compression, communication, and consumption. We are interested in understanding how visual perception, cognition, and emotion can help optimize video services. One key area of focus is understanding and applying human visual perception, cognition, and social context to optimize video quality and reduce bandwidth needed for video services.
Dr. Rashad Jillani has extensive R&D experience in the area of video encoding, compression, and adaptation especially experienced in video encoding, H.264/AVC standard implementation including design and implementation of new low complexity video coding algorithms by employing machine learning techniques.
###### Standardization Research
* * *
We are actively involved in research related to audio-visual compression and communication standards. Our work includes low complexity encoding and transcoding of HEVC, AVC/H.264, and AV1. A related area of focus is video encoding and delivery optimization for mobile devices. Applying and optimizing WebRTC for realtime services is another area of interest.
###### Industry Experience
* * *
Dr. Rashad Jillani has extensive professional industry experience. He is a software engineer with over 10 years of professional experience in the full life cycle of software engineering starting from requirements gathering, design, prototype, development, testing and to the maintenance. He has advanced knowledge of developer applications, tools, methodologies and best practices (including OOD, design patterns, UML and Rational Rose). He has experience working in Scrum/Agile methodology and managing Git repositories.
From 2000 to 2005, he has served as a software engineer, where he was responsible for different phases of full lifecycle development of web based application security platform, innerGuard, from initial requirement gathering to design, coding, testing, documentation, implementation and integration.
During his stay in USA, he has worked in the following organizations in various capacities as an expert in digital media system.
