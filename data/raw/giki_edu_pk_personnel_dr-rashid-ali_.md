###### Background
* * *
**Dr.Rashid Ali** main area of research is residual stress analysis in engineering materials for their influence on the static and fatigue performance of materials. During his Ph.D studies, he design and develop residual stress-optimized Ti-TiN multilayer PVD hard-coatings on compliant substrate (stainless steel) to increase the overall thickness of coating without deteriorating coating adhesion to the substrate. For an accurate measurement of practical adhesion of brittle coatings to the compliant substrate, he demonstrates the use of analytical modelling for the description of the failure modes under scratch adhesion testing. Moreover, the finite element (FEM) and experimental description of failures produced due to residual stresses and coating delamination related failures in materials were conducted. The work forms the basis to engineered stress-optimized multilayer coatings through FEM design for the use of multilayer coating in wide range of industrial applications. Further, he practically investigate the various failures in engineering components such as failure in melting crucible and performed design study to mitigate those failures; investigate the failure in roller bearing and failure in thermal barrier coating of turbine blades etc.
