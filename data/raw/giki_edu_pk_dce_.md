## Welcome to **Civil Engineering**
Our program is designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills required to become successful civil engineers. The Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) accreditation ensures that our program meets the highest standards of academic excellence and quality, making our graduates highly sought after by employers in Pakistan and around the world.
Civil engineering is a versatile field that primarily deals with infrastructure design, construction, and maintenance of physical structures, including structures, roads, bridges, buildings, dams, railways, and airports. Being the oldest among all the engineering professions, it encompasses many sectors, skills, and stakeholders from varied fields such as Structural Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Transportation & Highway Engineering, Project and Construction Management, Water Resources Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and Urban Planning.
### **Overview:**
Considering the pace of development in Pakistan, the Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute started the program of Civil Engineering in 2018. The Department offers a four years undergraduate program and a post graduate research degree in Civil Engineering. The department has foreign qualified faculty members with a wide range of experience and expertise to deliver knowledge scholastically and produce qualified engineers with the capabilities to redefine the future of the nation through the state-of-the-art infrastructure projects. The Department has fully equipped laboratories and well-furnished classrooms with high quality of digital tools for effective learning process.
All the sub disciplines of Civil Engineering have been impeccably incorporated in the curricula of the program. Along with the laboratory tasks pertaining to academics and research work, all labs are well-equipped to carry out the commercial testing as well.
### **Mission:**
The department aims to produce competent engineers who can work in the society, both as field professionals and academic researchers. The department also aspires to produce engineers who are able to provide solutions to various contemporary issues in the construction industry by unifying the theories, technical knowledge and practices of Civil Engineering.
