To create an atmosphere for nurturing ideas into commercialized products, GIK Institute in partnership with the Directorate General of Science and Technology (DoST) Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has set up a state-of-the-art Incubation facility called the Catalyst. The facility allows budding entrepreneurs access to the latest technology equipment, machinery and research know-how necessary to facilitate product design and commercialization. Top teams are selected from business plan competitions held regularly throughout the year.
The Catalyst GIK Incubator is a technology incubator and the only residential Incubator in Pakistan, where start-ups live on the campus free of cost and spend most of their time building the next big thing. Funded and supported by Directorate of Science and Technology, Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
