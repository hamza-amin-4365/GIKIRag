# BS in Chemical Engineering
Rapid commercialization of conventional and modern, man-made products gave birth to process industry. The dynamics of the industry requires group of highly trained professionals from almost all engineering disciplines. However chemical engineer organizes his/her coordination at the process plant and thus deemed as process brain. Such responsibility demands basic knowledge of all conventional trades of engineering in addition to in-depth knowledge of large-scale industrial dynamics. Continuous and safe process operation is an exclusive responsibility of this trade, in addition to design, problem investigation and troubleshooting. Well-versed chemical engineer, during his/her career, usually encounters a diverse field of application in thermodynamics dictating unit processes.
Department of Chemical Engineering is endeavouring to achieve excellence as per requirements of Outcome Based Education (OBE) system to enhance the capabilities of its graduates. The department offers a 4-years degree program in chemical engineering detailing basic principles and mathematics of process operations in the first two years. Third & final year deal with the advanced level of the trade closely selected to cope the industrial requirements.
The newly established laboratories are the prime feature, providing state of the art equipment. Most of the laboratories are designed having conventional features imitated by the more sophisticated and risk-free digital equipment. Experiments are designed to trigger the thinking of students and not just mere data logging.
## **DChE Mission**
The mission of the department of chemical engineering is to develop and disseminate the understanding of designing and operations of chemical processes so that our graduates can excel in academia, research, business, and industry to contribute ethically for the humanistic development of the society.
