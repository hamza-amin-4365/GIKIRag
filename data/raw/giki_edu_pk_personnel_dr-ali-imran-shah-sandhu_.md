### Dr. Ali Imran Sandhu 
Assistant Professor FCSE
Ali Imran Sandhu (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI), Lahore, Pakistan, in 2007, the M.S. degree in communication engineering from the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Division of Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia, in 2020.
Dr. Sandhu is a humble individual with 10+ years of interdisciplinary research experience at the intersection of:
(i) developing numerical solvers for forward and inverse electromagnetic (imaging) problems,
(ii) integration of scientific machine learning algorithms, and generative adversarial neural networks (GANs) with numerical electromagnetic, and acoustic wave propagation models, and
(iii) designing phased array antennas and microwave devices.
From 2011 to 2013, he was a Research Engineer with the Microwave Laboratory, University of Calabria, Rende, Italy. From August 2007 to September 2021, he was a Lecturer with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, CUI, where he taught at undergraduate and graduate levels. During September 2021 to August 2023, Dr. Sandhu has been a postdoctoral fellow with the Center of Integrative Petroleum Research, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM).
His research interests include applied computational electromagnetics with an emphasis on the characterization of electromagnetic fields and wave interactions in complex geometries, solutions for 2-D and 3-D joint electromagnetic and seismic inverse problems incorporating signal processing and machine learning techniques, integration of physics-informed machine learning with numerical wave propagation solvers, and Bayesian experimental design for efficient sensor placement in an imaging framework.
He was a finalist in the student poster competition at the 2016 IEEE IST Conference and secured the best student paper nomination at the 2017 IEEE Applied Computational Electromagnetics Society Conference.
He received two bronze medals for securing distinction in his undergraduate discipline at the campus as well as at institute levels at COMSATS University Islamabad.
Dr. Sandhu is a self-motivated and detailed-oriented individual with excellent communication skills. He is educated and trained throughout in a diverse and cross-cultural environment. He is currently serving as an assistant professor at the faculty of computer science and engineering at the GIK Institute Pakistan.
