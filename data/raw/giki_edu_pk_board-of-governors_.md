The Board of Governors sits at the apex of the statutory pyramid of the Institute and its composition is the same as that of the General Council of the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Sciences and Technology. It has overall control of the Institute, and has the powers to create new components of the Institute such as a school, faculty or any other teaching or research unit, and to change constitution of its Executive Committee and Governing Council.
