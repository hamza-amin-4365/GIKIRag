**Dear Alumni,**
_Assalaam o Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah_
I hope this message will find you in best of health and spirits. In this blessed Month of Ramadan, I ask Allah to bless you and your family and to make this a month of renewal and strength. Amen!
_Please send this appeal to your friends and family, and share to Facebook, Twitter and other web portals._
GIK Alumni Association is in the process of fundraising effort to secure funds for the next year (2013-14) to run the financial assistance programs and other initiatives under way. The biggest challenge for us this year is to raise enough funds to cover tuition for more than Eighty [80] students who desperately need our help to continue their education at GIK Institute and to extend the monthly stipend program to Sixty [60] students.
We are very proud of our alumni members and with the efforts of the previous Executive Council and volunteers we were able to meet and exceed our targets for the last year. In fact, we are running a surplus and you can find all of the details in the [annual report.](https://www.giki.edu.pk/Alumni/AnnualReport)
However due to an increase in number of applicants for financial assistance program this year we are setting a lofty target of Rupees 30 Million. We are aiming to raise Rupees 15 Million in the holy month of Ramadan. As Ramadan is divided into three parts, our fundraising goal is similarly divided as follows:
  * Rs. 5 Million in the first ten days
  * Rs. 5 Million in the second ten days
  * Rs. 5 Million in the last ten days


**REMEMBER** : Contributions to GIKAA are Zakat-eligible and in USA they are tax-deductible.
Please consider giving $250, $500, $1,000, $2,500, $5,000, or whatever you can comfortably donate. We appreciate any contribution you make.
Thank you for joining us on this journey and looking forward to your continued support and interest. We will be providing you more updates over next few weeks about these and other programs and progress on fund collection campaign.
Yours sincerely,
**Irfan Ul Haq Chaudhry (Batch 1)**  
**President GIK Alumni Association**
P.S. â€“ Please make a commitment to pay your Zakat to GIKAA during Ramadan and urge your friends and relatives to make the same commitment.
