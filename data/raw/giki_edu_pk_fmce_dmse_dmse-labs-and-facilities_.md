FMCE has recently established an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) laboratory for materials characterization especially at nano scale level. AFM is an advanced characterisation technique capable of performing many kinds of materials analysis i.e. high resolution imaging, magnetic characterization, nano lithography, nano indentation etc. The AFM lab is useful both for the teaching and research work. A polarized light microscope is also available for capturing colored microscopic images.
