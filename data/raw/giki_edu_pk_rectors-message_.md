Over the years the reputation of the GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology has been built on the quality of its faculty, students and the facilities, particularly the laboratories. And so it has been in 2019-20. Faculty members, who have outstanding academic credentials, have been publishing their research in journals of high repute, often with the collaboration of universities abroad. They have won numerous awards, including for “Outstanding Research” and “Best Research Paper”, by the Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan. A record number of research projects were funded by external agencies.
A major highlight of the year was when the Institute was ranked by Times Higher Education (THE) at Number 24 in the world (and Number one in Pakistan) for “Quality Education”, in its University Impact Rankings in relation to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals.
Starting with just 120 students in 1993, the GIK Institute now has just over 2,000. With only five disciplines in 1993, and without a graduate program then, there now are 11 disciplines. The graduate program was introduced in 2001, and more than 200 students are enrolled in the program. This growth has been possible because of the strong support of our alumni, the members of the Board of Governors and our many other friends and well-wishers. For that, we commend them, and thank them. I am very happy to say that from the Fall 2020 academic session, GIK is introducing another discipline at the undergraduate level, that of BS in Artificial Intelligence, with the support of Huawei – one of the world’s leading and most reputable multinational companies. This, “BS in AI – Partnered by Huawei”, program is one of a kind outside of China, and is a reflection of the stature of the GIK Institute. We expect this will lead to further collaboration between GIK and Huawei, which had earlier established a Network Training Academy on campus.
GIK is a not-for-profit institution where everyone – boys, girls and faculty – all live on a neat, clean, functional campus. Admission is entirely on merit and, thus, quite competitive. While the academics are rather rigorous, you will also find a large variety of activities and facilities outside the classroom that will help you develop a range of skills, including self-confidence, that you will find very useful later in life. The Institute feels that talented individuals of limited means must also be given the opportunity of benefitting from what is on offer here. Thus, GIK provides a substantial number of scholarships and long term interest free loans to such students from its own resources. In addition, it has arrangements for addition financial assistance facilities with a number of its partners.
I thank you for considering the possibility of becoming a part of the GIK family, and wish you the best in your endeavors to achieve your dreams.
