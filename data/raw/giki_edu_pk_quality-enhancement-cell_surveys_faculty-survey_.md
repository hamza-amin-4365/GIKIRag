#### GIK Institute Faculty Satisfaction Survey
**Introduction**
The purpose of this survey is to assess faculty members’ satisfaction level with nature of work (teaching, research, service); institutional leadership and governance; resources and support; interdisciplinary work, collaboration, and mentoring; tenure and promotions; Faculty/Department’s engagement, quality & collegiality; appreciation and recognition and retention, and negotiation.
The faculty satisfaction survey will be useful in enhancing and improving the work environment and processes at the Institute. This is done by sharing important findings of the survey with management of the Institute for continuous quality improvement. It also helps to identify strengths and weaknesses that could be capitalized upon or enhanced to improve the overall performance of the Institute. These data, along with many other forms of evidence, can apprise institutional improvement efforts for the future.

**How Faculty Satisfaction Survey results are used for Continuous Quality Improvement**
Like other surveys, once the Faculty Satisfaction Survey data collection is closed, a report is made on the survey results, to identify areas of strengths and weaknesses. The report is then disseminated to the institute’s management. The results of the survey are primarily used by the institute’s management to identify areas for improvement and take corresponding corrective actions. It is a requirement of HEC from 2020 that the university management should provide an action plan against weak areas identified in the survey results.
