The founding fathers of the Institute were conscious of the fact that in spite of all the idealism one may have, new institutions tend to regress towards the existing models, and fail thereby to live up to the ideals which inspired their creation. They, therefore, took care to build monitoring devices to keep up Institute‚Äôs standards of education and research. One such device is the International Advisory Board consisting of scientists, engineers, and academicians of international standing. The Board sets up international standards for the Institute in terms of the quality of education and research, caliber of the faculty, revision and review of the curricula, and adequacy of the laboratory and library facilities. It also reviews the developmental programs of the Institute and provides guidelines for its growth in the future.
The present Advisory Board comprises the following:
