**MS degree**
The courses offered by the FES are categorized as core courses and elective courses. A student, specializing in any area, will be required to take minimum of two core courses and remaining from elective courses. The electives may be selected with the consultation of the advisor.
**PhD degree**
The course work to be taken by a student will be decided by a PhD Guidance Committee and approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies. Out of the eight courses, four must be related to his/her area of specialization.
