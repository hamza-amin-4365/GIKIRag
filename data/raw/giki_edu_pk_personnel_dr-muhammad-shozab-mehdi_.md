### Dr. Muhammad Shozab Mehd
Assistant Professor
## Qualifications: 
Ph.D
## Research Interests:
Hydrodynamics and Mass Transfer Study of Multiphase flows.
## Background
* * *
**Dr. Shozab** has joined GIKI in January this year. His PhD thesis is based on Hydrodynamics and Mass Transfer Study of Taylor Flow in a Capillary for Monolith Reactor.
During his PhD he developed slurry type Taylor flow in a capillary to determine hydrodynamics of three phase flows. He also got a chance to work in French Lab where he was able to learn some advance experimental techniques such as High Speed Imaging and Planer Laser Induced Fluorescence for gas – liquid mass transfer study.
