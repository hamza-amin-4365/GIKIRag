### BS in **Engineering****Science**
#### **Introduction**
Bachelor of Science in Engineering Sciences is a unique multidisciplinary Engineering Program in Pakistan, duly recognized by the Pakistan Engineering Council.**The 4-year engineering degree encompasses some of the most modern fields of engineering, split into two specializations, namely, (i) Photonics and Microelectronics, and (ii) Modeling, Simulation, and Machine Learning.** Both areas of concentration require in-depth exposure to both science and engineering. The goal of this program is to develop each student’s ability to think analytically across disciplines and develop a knowledge base well-suited to tackle future technical challenges that will require a thorough understanding of a discipline in the physical sciences combined with engineering. Over the years, Engineering Sciences graduates have gone on to become successful engineers, managers, researchers, and academicians, working in fields such as medical imaging, optical communications, instrumentation, sensors, control, chip design, operations management, data science, artificial intelligence, and software solutions.
The vigorous growth of the photonic industries, lasers, semiconductor and microelectronics, Instrumentation and process control, simulation of systems, data analytics, and machine learning has created a demand for engineers who can completely cope with the present and future demands of the modern industry. Light, in particular, laser, has become the workhorse and the instrument of choice both in research and industry, covering engineering applications from communications to instrumentation. Importance of Semiconductors and Microelectronics continues to grow and the introduction of software-based design of devices as the new “fabless” industry is bringing new opportunities to Pakistan. Simulation and Machine Learning are now the key design and decision-making tools being used across the world.
The graduates of Engineering Sciences will be suitable for industry that is involved not only in production but also in research and development both within the country and abroad. Already, within the country, several organizations are pursuing R&D work and production in engineering field of technologies. At present the main power for such organizations in these fields is either trained or the assistance of foreign consultants is sought. The graduates of this faculty will be well equipped to fill this gap in national expertise and can look forward to highly rewarding careers both locally and globally.
#### **Thrust Areas**
The undergraduate program of Faculty of Engineering Sciences is duly accredited under Washington Accord Level-II category of Outcome Based Education (OBE) system by the Pakistan Engineering Council. To complete the degree requirement, students must complete 19 credit hours in one of the specialization fields mentioned below. Students are assigned projects and suitable advanced elective courses to develop expertise in the specialized areas. Students are required to opt for the specialization in the third year (5th Semester) of their undergraduate degree plan. Following are the two specialization streams offered by FES:
  * Photonics and Microelectronics
  * Modeling, Simulation, and Machine Learning
