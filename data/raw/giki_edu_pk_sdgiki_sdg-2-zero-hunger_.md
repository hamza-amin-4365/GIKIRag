  * **Project Topi Ramadan Ration Drive 2024**


Project Topi has successfully donated 333 ration bags to families in need during this blessed month of Ramazan. These bags, which provide essential food items, are already making a significant difference in the lives of many struggling families. However, there are still over 250 families waiting for assistance, and we need your continued help to ensure no one is left behind. Each ration bag costs Rs. 5340, and your donation can bring relief to those who need it most. Together, we can make this Ramazan a little brighter for our community.
