We are passing through the ‘information age’ in which information extraction and processing plays a vital role in many disciplines from engineering to computer science, economics, biology etc. Vectors and matrices provide a useful framework for the storage and processing of information. The _language_ of vectors and matrices is known as Linear Algebra in mathematics. This course aims to introduce the basic notions and concepts related to vectors and matrices and the operations that are performed on them which allows them to be applied to real-world problems. Application examples will also be discussed to demonstrate the importance of linear algebra in different fields such as engineering, computer science and economics. The essential goal of the course is thus to make the students comfortable with the _language_ of matrices and vectors so that not only they are familiar with the important terms and notions related to vectors and matrices, but that they are also able to apply important operations on vectors and matrices to different type of problems including physical and real-world problems.

**Course Introduction**  
---  
We are passing through the era of ‘digital’ revolution. From small devices such as watches, calculators to more complex devices, like a microprocessor in a Personal Computer, all of these devices are based on digital data. These devices require representation of input and output data in a digital/binary format, and then processing (addition, multiplication etc.) of this data. The course of digital logic designs aims to provide an understanding of basic concepts related to digital data representation and processing. Concepts such as binary representation of numbers, basic operations (e.g. addition, multiplication etc.) on the binary numbers and fundamental building blocks of a digital system which are known as ‘logic gates’, will be introduced in the first half of this course. The latter half of the course will deal with the construction of more advanced devices such as counters, digital data storage devices etc. The concepts learned in this course will act as fundamentals for higher level courses in digital system design such as Computer Architecture (ES-213) and Microprocessor Interfacing (ES-314)

**Course Introduction**  
An understanding of thermal physics is crucial to almost all modern physics (from astrophysics, atmospheric physics, laser physics, condensed matter physics and information theory) and to the important technological challenges which face us in this century. It includes the fundamentals of classical thermodynamics (which was founded largely in the nineteenth century and motivated by a desire to understand the conversion of heat into work using engines) and also statistical mechanics (which was founded by Boltzmann and Gibbs, and is concerned with the statistical behaviour of the underlying microstates of the system); but the traditional focus of thermodynamics on steam engines seems remote and largely irrelevant to a twenty-first century student. This course provides an introduction to the key concepts in thermal physics, fleshed out with plenty of modern examples. The relevant mathematical principles, particularly concerning probability and statistics, will be introduced with in the first two weeks.  
**Course Content**  
· Mathematical preliminaries (Combinatorics and Probability) · Macrostates and microstates · Kinetic theory of gases (Maxwell Boltzmann distribution) · Zeroth and First Law of Thermodynamics · Second law of thermodynamics · Entropy · Maxwell relations · Introductory statistical mechanics

The primary goal of this lab is to train students to solve real-world optimization problems. In the planning or operation of an engineering system, engineers have to make technological and managerial decisions at several stages. The ultimate objective of all such decisions is to make optimal actions that result in a minimum effort required or to maximize the desired outcomes. This lab will introduce optimization tools, which will help students model an engineering design problem as an optimization problem, and then solve them with appropriate optimization methods.

Pre-Requisite: Foundations of Photonics Instructors: Office Hours:  
**Course Introduction**  
---  
This course introduces the basic principles of two- and three-dimensional imaging systems. It begins with the mathematical description of image formation as a linear system and draws on the student’s knowledge of signals and systems to introduce the concepts of point spread function, transfer function, resolution, and restoration. Actual physical imaging systems (such as microscopes, telescopes, and copiers) operating in the gazing and scanning configurations are subsequently modeled and their resolution assessed. Interferometric imaging systems and their applications in metrology are described. Techniques for depth profiling are then introduced including point-by-point scanning (as in laser scanning fluorescence microscopy), echo ranging (as in sonar and radar imaging), and interferometry (as in optical coherence tomography). This is followed by an introduction to computational imaging, including the techniques of computed tomography (CT), range tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hyperspectral imaging systems and their various configurations are then described including applications in detection (of tumors, for example) and classification (of different targets). Performance measures such as sensitivity and specificity are introduced. Applications for remote sensing, nondestructive testing, and biology and medicine are highlighted.

Pre-Requisite: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations (MT201) and Foundations of photonics (ES2XX) Instructors: Office Hours:  
**Course Introduction**  
---  
Geometric optics is the study of light in its simplest form by treating light as rays. Light rays travel in straight lines until they encounter an interface (such as a mirror or a lens) where they may be redirected by reflection and refraction. This course describes the physical principles that determine how rays behave at various interfaces. These principles are then used to model simple optical systems with varying degrees of fidelity. Natural optical phenomena (rainbows, mirages, total-internal reflection, etc.) and classic optical systems (prisms, telescopes, cameras, etc.) will be analyzed throughout the course. Linear systems will be introduced to analyze more complex optical systems. This course provides the fundamentals needed for optical system design.  
**Course Contents**  
Course Outline will be composed of the following topics: 1. Introduction to Geometric Optics – Light as Rays: Wave nature of light, propagation in homogeneous media, wavefronts and rays, radiometry, limits of geometrical optics. 2. Planar Optical Surfaces: Refractive index, optical path length, Fermat’s principle, Snell’s law, reflection and refraction, plane parallel plates, prisms, optical materials. 3. Curved Optical Surfaces: Image formation, lenses, optical spaces, image types, shape of optical surfaces, ray tracing, paraxial approximation. 4. Imaging: Lens design, thin lens model, magnification, ZZ’ diagram, cardinal points, Gaussian optics, thick lenses, mirrors. 5. Apertures: Aperture stop, field stop, F-number, numerical aperture, depth of focus. 6. Example Optical Systems: Telescopes, cameras, microscopes, luminaires, concentrators, displays.
