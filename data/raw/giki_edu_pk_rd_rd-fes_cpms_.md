Introduction
### Computational Physics, Modeling and Simulation Group (CPMS)
Study of our Universe is by no means an easy task. The complex astrophysical phenomena involved makes the problem very challenging and indeed knowhow of basic sciences, engineering, modeling and simulation is the minimal requirement for a better understanding of our Universe. The nucleosynthesis problem (r-, s-, p- and rp-process), evolution phases of stars and supernova explosions are few astrophysical phenomena that require microscopic calculation of weak interaction rates at high temperatures (of the order of billions of kelvin) and high densities (of the order of 1011 g/cm3). Besides we also need calculation of other input data before we can run the mega codes on supercomputers to model these phenomena. Our group is part of a world-wide effort to microscopically calculate the inputs for these simulation and modeling codes. The group is mainly concerned with the calculation of nuclear data. The results are then given to collaborators running the simulation codes. Various nuclear models (e.g. QRPA, shell model) are employed to calculate the inputs. Numerical techniques, computer programming and understanding of the physical phenomena are the basic requirements in our group.
