**Anti-Harassment Seminar by WES 19th September 2023**
The Anti-Harassment Campaign seminar organized by the Women Engineering Society (WES) under the GIKI Department of Student Affairs, in collaboration with the Anti-Harassment Cell, aligns closely with SDG 5: Gender Equality. SDG 5 emphasizes the importance of ending all forms of discrimination, violence, and harmful practices against women and girls, and ensuring full participation and equal opportunities for all.
By raising awareness about harassment and creating a platform for discussion, the seminar addressed key issues related to gender-based violence and harassment, which disproportionately affect women in educational and workplace settings. The seminar’s focus on creating a respectful and protective environment directly contributes to the goals of SDG 5 by:
1. Promoting gender equality: By fostering a campus culture that prioritizes respect, safety, and accountability, the seminar directly supports SDG 5’s targets on eliminating violence and harmful practices against women and girls.
2. Encouraging reporting and intervention: The event provided guidance on mechanisms for reporting and addressing harassment, empowering individuals—especially women—to stand up against harassment and seek support. This contributes to the creation of safer, more inclusive spaces for everyone, particularly women and marginalized groups.
3. Building awareness and empathy: The seminar helped to break down the stigma around discussing harassment and encouraged a culture of empathy and understanding, which is essential for promoting gender equality and reducing gender-based violence.
Through these efforts, the seminar represents a critical step in building a safer and more supportive educational environment, aligned with the broader goals of SDG 5 to ensure gender equality and empower all women and girls.

**WES Self Defense Workshop March 2023**
The WES Self-Defense Workshop, held in March 2023 at the GIK Institute, was an empowering event designed to equip participants with practical skills to protect themselves in potentially dangerous situations. Organized by the Women Engineering Society (WES), the workshop aimed to foster confidence and resilience, particularly among women, by teaching basic self-defense techniques and raising awareness about personal safety. The workshop not only provided valuable physical skills but also promoted mental preparedness and a sense of empowerment, encouraging participants to take control of their safety and well-being.
This initiative aligns closely with SDG 5: Gender Equality, as it directly addresses one of the key challenges faced by women and girls globally—violence and the lack of personal safety. By empowering women with the tools and knowledge to defend themselves, the workshop contributed to SDG 5’s goal of eliminating all forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls. It also supports the target of enhancing women’s access to education, opportunities, and decision-making, helping to create an environment where women can live and thrive without fear of violence. The workshop further emphasizes the importance of building self-confidence and agency in women, key elements of achieving gender equality.

**Breast Cancer Awareness Panel talk by Women Engineering Society**
On March 6th, the Women Engineering Society (WES) at GIK Institute hosted an informative panel discussion in collaboration with Pink Ribbon, titled “Empowering Women: Prioritizing Breast Health through Awareness and Lifestyle Choices.” The event focused on raising awareness about breast cancer, its impact on women, and the importance of making informed lifestyle choices for better health. Expert speakers from Pink Ribbon shared crucial information on early detection, prevention, and the significance of regular health check-ups. The panel emphasized that breast cancer affects us all—regardless of age or background—but by educating ourselves and making proactive health decisions, we can reduce risks and empower women to take charge of their health.
This initiative strongly aligns with SDG 5: Gender Equality, particularly its target to improve women’s health and well-being. By promoting breast cancer awareness and encouraging healthier lifestyle choices, WES contributed to advancing the goals of SDG 5 by ensuring women have access to the knowledge and resources they need to make informed health decisions. Health is a critical aspect of gender equality, and this event helped empower women by providing them with tools to prioritize their physical well-being, thereby fostering a culture of care and preventive action.

**GIK Institute and Women University Swabi signed an MoU for academic collaboration, joint research, and exchange**
GIK Institute and Women University Swabi recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for academic collaboration, joint research, and student exchange, marking a significant step toward fostering gender equality in higher education. This partnership aims to create opportunities for women students and researchers to engage in academic growth, cross-institutional learning, and collaborative research projects, with a focus on promoting women’s participation in STEM fields and other academic disciplines. Through this MoU, both institutions aim to empower women by providing them with access to resources, knowledge, and networks that will help advance their academic and professional careers.
This collaboration aligns directly with SDG 5: Gender Equality, as it addresses the need to ensure equal access to education and opportunities for women. By focusing on joint research and academic exchanges, the partnership works toward breaking down barriers that women often face in academia and the workforce. It also encourages the inclusion of women in research and innovation, areas where they have historically been underrepresented. This initiative promotes the empowerment of women and girls, supporting SDG 5’s target of enhancing their full participation in education, science, and technology, and creating environments where women can thrive and lead in academic and professional spaces.
